              "Nice, cozy apartment. İt is right next to the metro so commuting is easy.    The building is top level with great amenities. Everyone is kind and helpful. Thank you Ogün for hosting us She accepted booking but told me not to go the day before arrival. Said she couldn't cancel but over 10 days and hasn't replied about compensation The place was too small. The shower place was right in front of toilet and there wasn’t a separate place for the shower. Instead it was right in front of the toilet that it was so unhygienic. So be aware for those who want to book this place. The WiFi was unreliable. The WiFi on the main bed area was too slow or not there at all. We had to be away from the bed every time if we needed to reconnect to the WiFi.       Also, our original stay was 29 days, but we changed it to 11 days stay. Before changing our dates we’re told by the host that we will get half of the refund which we never did. Airbnb told us to speak to the host, but he never replied back. He basically lied to us and stole our refund and charged us huge amount per day to stay. Horrible experience. Really nice and big apartment, stylish, very spacious and well located. Comfortable, easy check in and Meric is a really kind, thoughtful host. The location is very good (one of the reasons I love Cihangir), you can get anywhere by tram or walking. And, all you need is inside the apartment. The only thing this place is missing to get 10 points out of 10 is a spring/general cleaning and some minor refreshing for the furniture. The stay was great! As described and actually bigger than I thought it would be based on the photos. Situated in a residential neighborhood but minutes walk to restaurants, bars, Galata tower and Beyoğlu, with a delicious pide place around the block. Walking and public transport is super easy, it’s a short walk to the tram. Taking a taxi to and from here is very difficult if not impossible (public transport is the way to go!). Eyp and Ali had excellent communication during the checkin and checkout process and for any recommendations in between. I’d definitely stay here again, thanks! Very good and easy place! Thank you! Nice location & close to Taksim Square. Dogan & his friends were very nice down to earth group of people. He always responded quick & he was nice enough to let me check out late without additional charge Graet place and Enes great person. I will back agein Mrs shehnaz was very helpful, the apartment was very clean , comfortable, amazing, great location and every thing was perfect . The apartments is great! The view from the apartment is awesome! Mehmet is very nice and kind, helps out all the time we had some good days at Taner's apartment. The only problem was that the kitchen was not clean, but the rest of the apartment was ok! I told Taner who said he will be carefull for next time. The bed is very good and the localisation too. I stayed here for one month. The apartment is very spacious and clean, just like the pictures show. The location is amazing: very close to the main street and the neighborhood is great. We had a 24/7 doorman that took care of all our needs and the communication with the host was good.    We would defintily come again. Thank you! The apartament IS very clean and the room IS very confortable with amazing views to Sultanhamet. Sev IS quiet helpful. The only inconvenient IS fue to the fact we couldn't cook there is a fridge in the bathroom for the food. I think It can be put It in a better place. Amazing host and an amazing experience. The host is really nice and always ready to help. The apartment has the perfect location and it’s so much more than the photos, I was really surprised. Can’t wait to come back really soon! I strongly recommend! :) Very good host, happy to help with everything.      Spacious room, with everything you may need. Aksel is an excellent host.  Available, attentive and always ready to help.  The apartment is clean and well located.  I recommend Everthing was fine!! The communication was so good. The Location was really Good. Deniz helped us with Any question. Comming back next year! The home is lovely, well designed, clean, and secure. There is a parking area and playing ground for kids and security guards in front of the entrance of the building complex.  There all amenities in the home. Workers are kind and reachable anytime. If you don't have a car, it can not be easy to reach the city center. The subway is 4 km far from here. There are markets and bus stops near it. Very nice, clean, and spacious place. Has everything you need. Great view. Location is great lots of shops and restaurants in the area. We enjoyed our stay at Semih apartment.  It has a lovely living room. The kitchen has all necessary kitchenware. Great location, just couple minutes walking distance to Istiklal street. We had very easy check in. The apartment is on the fifth floor with no elevator. This is why we would recommend this place for younger and/or well fit travelers. The host is amazing! Place is perfect and clean and nice. Thank u so much Very unique accomodation to stay at on a beautiful island I have spent two weeks in Fehmi's Appartment with my family. Everything went excellent. the location is perfect. Very closed to the most important monuments in Istanbul. Pictures are accurate. Place is nice. Check in was very smooth. The only problem was the place had a bad smell of sewage. I think for the price they should take care of that. Unfortunately my travel plans changed so I didn’t actually stay at this hotel; but the host communication was really good. The flat was really nice and the greeting perfect I had a great couple of stays in Tunç´s apt. Only a short walk from the tramstation. The terrace view is magnificant, the wifi is fast and Tunç is a very helpful host! We had a great time at Gizem's place. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. Gizem was very respectful and helpful during our stay. Would absolutely recommend to stay there! Pictures make the place seem much larger— great location but not quite hospitable enough. This place is ideal for people looking to stay in a trendy neighborhood with good food and bars that still has some authentic middle-class flavor. It’s also strategically located for getting around the city, with the ferry to all the main landmarks of Istanbul just 10 minutes away walking. It was also nice to be somewhere that the call to prayer didn’t wake me up every morning at dawn, as this was an issue at other places I have stayed in Istanbul. The room itself has a big, comfy bed and everything is kept clean and orderly in the apartment. Wifi was also reliable for working. Mucahid is very friendly and easy to communicate with. Everything was very good, Demis is nice and responsive host. Location of apartment is amazing, everything matches the photos So easy and in the middle of everything thank you so much for always responding quickly One of the best places. Highly recommend. Great hospitality, very clean modern and comfy place to stay. Great communication and great apartment! The wifi was sometimes too slow, but mostly my staying was comfortable there. He immediately confirmed my reservation request, which I made around 23.30 at night. A few minutes later, I called him, but first he said that he can not afford the accommodation, then he told accepted the reservation by mistake. There may be a misunderstanding, but I don't think so. I didn't get 1/5 of my payment back. He did not even call and say anything or  say his placate  for the loss of money, which developed out of didn't my control for hi's maked mistake and was not the cause of me. We really enjoyed our time here in Uskudar. Our host was amazing as she helped us in getting familiar with the area by showing us where the local markets were located and helped us in getting some of the more important things set-up to help make our trip smoother. We highly recommend her as being a wonderful host and recommend this place for others to stay as it has a wonderful view of the Bhosphorus and is centrally located for restaurants, cafes and markets within a short walking distance to the apartment. the host was the reason we had a great stay in istanbul. we are very grateful for the hospitality and do not regret the choice at any time.  ! highly recommended ! A room with a small garden in Balat. The location is central and within cafes. If you want to have a kitchen to cook your own meals. But since the prices are quite cheap, you do not need it much. A good choice for travelers and those who are interested in the local life of Istanbul. The host responds quickly to every question, and the tips work quite well. I'll come again. Very good service The neighborhood may be a trouble for some. The place is good as it is shown in the picture. However, due to the thin wall you may hear people talking in the lobby. Very nice and comfortable flat , where you can fill herself like at home. Location is perfect. Around your building a lot of food stores, where you can buy fresh fish and meet, cookies and fresh bakery, fruits  and vegetables. The public transportation ( buses , Marmaray, mobile buses etc ) - everything in a stone’s throw from you . Arzu and Ozancan very hospitable . The apartment provides everything for a comfortable stay. Highly recommended! The flat and balcony are very cosy, everything was great. Onur helped with all questions I had. The location is good, the big shopping mall is near the house, a tram and metro station also are close, so there aren't any problems with transportation. It is amazing   Nice apartment for good value   Nice location 5 min walk to taksim metro where you can go almost everywhere in Istanbul   Every thing you need is available ( fridge , hairdryer , iron and etc )    Easy to access with self check in   Very recommended  Excellent location at the heart of Istanbul in a vibrant neighborhood. The place was sparkling clean and Sabahattin was very welcoming and easy to communicate with. Highly recommended! Location is great,if you need shopping street, it’s 10 min walk, if you want to go to port to catch the boat, it’s 5 min walk, full of artistic and traditional shops. Lot of great restaurants just around you. Apartment is great. Amazing view, very clean, comfortable and cozy. Bahar is an amazing person. She is always available if you need help. She is super host. Very kind, very helpful. This place for me is highly recommend. We choose the apartment of Emrah, because it was not overcrowded district , but from other side it was close enough to the city center. Emrah met us at the door, showed everything in the apartment and kept in touch with us during our stay. The apartment looks like in the photo, equiped with everything you may need. There are product shops not far from the apartment, a lot of cafes, restaurant. The metro station is also close. Perfect experience!    As a big group, we had an amazing time at this newly renovated and big apartment, which is 5 minutes by walk to Taxim Square / Metro and airport shuttle . The location is great because it is closed to many restaurants, bars and shops. Thank you for the tips!   Hope to see you again! Levent was the nicest and most helpful host I’ve ever met. His place is charming and cozy, only 5 minutes walk from the blue mosque and public transportation (T1) and it is surrounded by a lot of restaurants and terraces. Levent was always super quick to answer our messages and made our trip one of the best and most unforgettable for my family and I.   Thank you so so much and I hope to see you next time when we’ll be back to Istanbul Inchaalah ☺️ Amazing apartment with everything one might need.    Location is excellent and w short distance to taksim and istiqlal.   Highly recommended I strongly recommend Ceren's home. It is fairly clean and it has almost everything for a short stay (I was there for 2 weeks). Ceren is perfectly accessible and responds to all my concerns/requests.   Just some points to keep in mind before book the house:   1) The streets in that part of Istanbul are steep.    2) The floors are thin and you could hear the neighbors on upper floor walking, though this was no problem for me. Nice and clean place to stay Great place when staying in Istanbul with the family! Emirhan’s apartment is spotless clean, with a fantastic view on the Bosporus! And Emirhan communicates very clearly and is very responsive to questions! A very convenient location close to every part of the city. A stylish and cozy place respectful of the past. I hope to stay there once again Really nice stay in the heart of Istanbul.   The place was tidy and well located. Garen is a decent guy who you can depend on. I will stay silent about host . The room was clean and met all expectations for my short stay in Istanbul. Communication with Kürşad was nice and easy as well as check-in process.   Loved the super-convenient location around Galata district, few minutes walk to Şişane subway station.    Good for price/value ratio, can definitely recommend this listing. Super clean place with the nicest hosts on top, highly recommended. Amazing place with an amazing view of the sea. The hosts are so communicative and always willing to help. I would highly recommend staying at Efet & Memet's place. Staying in the studio was very lovely. The location is wonderful, the place is very clean and cosy, with a really nice shower and balcony. We only missed some kitchen amenities, but it is a minor problem given the number of restaurants around the area. Definitely recommendable! Yusuf and his colleague were very friendly and helpfull. They have asked me every question, they also managed covid test for me. Flat is nice, clean, in good location. If I will comeback to the Istanbul, I will definitely stay here! Nice stay in a central location. At first I was on the fence to rent this place since I had big luggages and with the apartment being located on the 2nd floor and no elevator, it would've been very hard to take the bags upstairs by myself. So I asked Metin if someone could help and he had somebody carry my luggage to the 2nd floor. I had to carry them downstairs by myself when I left tho which wasn't fun!   It is very close to Taksim square like 5 min walk and I could also walk to karaköy by the water in about 20 minutes. The only thing is that it's uphill when you go back so be prepared for that.   It can get very noisy at night. I woke up several times by the sound of cars honking on the street which is understandable since it's located near a busy street.   There is only one split unit in the living room that provides heating and cooling for the whole apartment and therefore some rooms like bedroom and kitchen don't get as much heat and remain chilly at night specially during cold seasons.   Communication with Metin went smoothly, he provided required supplies for bathroom within a day.    Pretty much anything you'd need is within a walking distance and I enjoyed my stay very much overall. This Airbnb was very nice and functional. The location is great close to everything. There is an elevator in the building which is great. The house was very big and can accommodate a lot of people. As for Emre he was very kind and helped us with many things. Had a great experience. Excellent location,  very close to istiklal street. Nice hosts, they made us feel like home. I’m coming back Forsure! Thanks to Erol and the hole Team, always helpful and kind. We had a great stay the room is nice and the location is close to the hotspots of Istanbul. We will come again In sha Allah. Thank you yaren, perfect location, clean      See you soon. I had a great time staying at this place, staff is quite friendly and helpful. All the main attractions are quite near to this location and there is easy access to transport. Tugce was nice, reactive and very helpful Good location and friendly staff. Lale is a nice lady, and the location is very good.   However the flat wasn't well equipped and wasn't clean. Also beds weren't comfortable. Cute little rooms with everything you need. I was living in an apartment located in the basement. This room apartment has 2 air conditioners so it's can help you to survive the heat. Guven is a very pleasant host, you can ask him for any advice, order food, or transfer to or from the airport. Great location, close you can find a lot of restaurants, 5 minutes walk to the Blue Mosque. Near the place small park to relax, and at the edge of it supermarket to buy all you need. Very nice and clean flat. Owner everytime answer for all questions and ready to help. Enjoyed my stay here in this lovely apartment. Bulent was also great & very helpful. I would definitely recommend and stay again. Great location and friendly & prompt manager. Hot water was challenging sometimes where the heather need to be refilled. This apartment is amazing! The location is perfect, it’s very clean and comfortable and there’s a great view of the Bosporus. Çagdas is an excellent host, he made sure that I had everything I needed during my stay and was kind enough to even make me breakfast on the first morning. I couldn’t ask for a better experience and I would definitely stay here again. Thanks so much! Elif hosted me on a very short notice! The communication was great and she offered to pick me up and was available for any questions. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The location was what I was looking in this area. Elif and her mom were very nice and hospitable. Had great conversations with Elif! Lucky to have her as a friend in Istanbul. We did not have the chance to meet Betal but he has been very accesible and caring before and during our accomadation. We enjoyed our stay in his super cozy apartment. The flat was clean, well-furnished and very central. Would highly recommend! Everything was good. It’s close to the airport but there are not too much public transport. Taxi was 50 TL. Breakfast was a good detail. My flight was delay and arrive so late (1:00am) and they wait for me. The only thing I can recommend improve is better communication. The answer were late. Consider in IST airport no WiFi, so it would  be great days before give all details. The apartment is located in a wonderful area full of cozy cafes and restaurants. Nearby there is a park and access to the sea. Ese greeted us warmly and showed us to our room, giving time for privacy. A little later, she took a short tour of the apartment and gave everything she needed to stay. It was very pleasant to communicate with her, and her cats have won our hearts. We only stayed for a day, but thanks for the time and comfort! Although it is near Taksim square, the neighborhood is crowded and not as safe as other neighborhoods there.   The building is an old one with lots of narrow stairs and a kind of smell can bee felt that may bothers.   The building does not have name and any receptionist. When I arrived the building was completely empty and a guy in the street who was Ferid's friend guided me to the apartment and gave me a pass for the building's entrance door.   It is a crowded neighborhood without and the view is not special.   In general I couldn't stay there and I do not offer it to visitors who are looking for a comfortable safe place. Amazing host with an amazing view and wonderful experience! The apartment was very nice, equipped with everything we needed. Location was perfect. It is a local area, not many people speak English but we enjoyed it. Away from touristic spots and crowds but at the same time surrounded by everything you need. Metro is just around the corner, two shops in the street, restaurants everywhere (very cheap)....   And of course, communication with a host was great! All recommendations! Everything was lovely. Better than in the photos and a very new and clean apartment. The location is perfect for sightseeing and there were plenty of amenities.  One of the best Airbnb stays I’ve had and definitely the best in Istanbul. I’ll definitely be back.  Thank   You! Nice, new and clean apartment with AMAZING view on Bosforus from main balcony!  Close enough to taxim and to boat station Great apartment, super location and super comfortable. Crazy view I totally recommend Beautiful apartment in Istanbul    Fully equipped with everything you could need and close to all the amenities Very nice apartment clean well located and missy is very helpful. Good place to stay for your holidays Yasin was the person who took care of everything he is brother of Hussain, he was very cooperative and great person and very respectful and responsive    I would definitely recommend him as a host to other people , I got to know Hussain during checking out and he helped me out with getting a taxi    Many Thanks for both Fantastic place, cant go wrong! Thank you very much for the hospitality, generousity and attention to detail. This was my first best experience in istanbul, it was like rediscovering Turkey's charm, taste and beauty all in one.  The location of the apartment was awesome, and the    furnishings are immaculate 5 star. I will definitely be returning in the future and recommending the place to my friends and relatives. Ali is good  young man l enjoyed his simplicity and kindness   we could talk about everything   he speaks 4 language it s nice for most of people to pass by his appartment   he will reveive you very plaisantly   see you Ali A beautiful little home in a beautiful neighborhood. I travelled alone so I was concerned about feeling safe, but the apartment turned out to be very secure; strong door with double lock and fortified windows. Gokce was accommodating and lovely. Beautiful room - maybe 4-5 minutes walk from Taksim, about 2 minutes walk from Acibadem hospital.    Easy to get the key, or get help 24 hours a day.    Good room, good location. Magdy is one of the kindness and hospital hosts I’ve ever had. He welcomed me and my family showed us around the apartment and how things function in the complex. The locations is far from all the noise downtown it’s in a quiet clean safe neighborhood. The buildings complex ranges from pools lakes walk ways. I wish I could’ve stayed longer. Magdys apartment has a everything for a great stay from kitchen utensils to house needs. I would always recommend this stay if your looking forward to stay in Instanbul away from the craziness of downtown but at the same time not far from the heart of Istanbul. Riza’s place is a pleasant flat in the heart of Beyoğlu with easy access to most tourist sights of Istanbul. I enjoyed my stay a great deal and would definitely come back. Points to note: neighborhood is slightly noisy and the flight of stairs are highly narrow and it is on the 3rd floor, so not friendly for those with physical disabilities. Thank you guys! All was perfect. Super clean, great location, awesome communication. Enjoyed my stay in Istanbul a lot  Nice and cosy as described, it was a great stay at Irem's place. Easy check in thanks to Mirac. Very close to Besiktas Carsi and Nisantasi with too many attractions. I would definitely stay again. Good place to spend a few nights the fridge did not work also the Wi-Fi was really slow and most of the times was not working. Good location restaurants and bars and markets are all in walking distance Yildiray’s place was really nice. The Apartment was super clean well equipped.  Would definitely stay again! The location is super convenient: the apartment is close to everything you need and the building in general is safe. Host is SUPER quick to response to any messages, questions and requests and is very welcoming. The thing that needs improvement is the fact the room is not really clean (the floor is pretty dirty) however for such price I believe this is a good option. In general, I enjoyed the apartment and the Marmara sea views from the living room and the balcony. Great place to stay if you are visiting/doing business in Deniz Istanbul Marina area. I loved the place .. it was very clean .. I could always reach the host .. he helped with whatever I asked.. the location I close to Istiklal street which is the main attraction in the area.. it’s a bit noisy .. but not so much after 10 pm .. it’s very cosy and very space efficient .. it would be perfect for 2 people but 3 can get by .. The apartment is located in the very center, near the Galata tower.  It is very convenient, there are shops and cafes.  There are tourist streets, and there are such streets where locals walk.  Nearby are the metro and the port.  The owner is very caring and helpful. We had a great stay thanks to Sadi and Hidir who helped us with all our questions! The apartement is cleaned daily, AC and washing machine work well. The location is very close to restaurants and the Blue Mosque. Would definitely come again! Murat is a great host. The apartment is centrally located close to Taksim. There are a few food options within 2 min walking, as well as a supermarket and a few mini markets. The apartment had functioning hot water and AC. The area is hilly (just be aware) like most of Istanbul. Great value for the price. Look forward to coming back and staying with Murat here! Good location +good location     good price     very friendly hosts, they helped us with everything we needed    security (they had cameras)      -old room and building    it didn't look exactly like the photos     not so safe area     noisy Apartments with a very convenient location in the heart of Istanbul.     The receptionist Yusuf was always friendly and helpful with organizational aspects.     A bit weak wi-fi, there were no slippers and it was not very clean in the bathroom, but it didn`t spoil the experience of the rest.  Good price / quality ratio Great apartment in a very good location. Lots of bars and restaurant on the street (that create a little noise during weekend, so be prepared). Apartment is big and comfy.    7 min walk to Galata Tower and 12-15 min to the nearest tramway, metro is 3 mins away, but we didn’t use it. the communication and helpfulness of the hosts is incredibly good and they were always easy to reach ... check in was very uncomplicated.      The apartment is on the 5th floor without a lift, but it is still unique. the furnishings leave nothing to be desired, everything is warmly furnished and the view is priceless. if we go to istanbul again ... and we will definitely ... then again in this unique apartment. I have nothing negative to say.      Thank you for this great stay   see you soon... The place is clean and tidy, the location is very good The best choice for istanbul excellent owner of an apartment with stunning views ‍♂️ Ayşe&Görkem are very nice hosts. The communication was fast and easy. We were able to check in earlier (thanks for that). The place is wonderfully located and has everything you might need for a short stay.  Just keep in mind that it's the fifth floor and no elevator but we were not bothered by that. Thanks again for a lovely stay Ayşe&Görkem! Pedram was really helpful and was easy to contact with him, we had some rooms issue, but Padram solve it and it was nice.      The room was really good and the location super nice, I totally recommend it  Umut is incredible. He was very accommodating and very quick to respond with any questions. He is also flexible with check-in and check-out time, which was extremely helpful. The place was very clean and had all of the necessities for a few night stay. Amazing location, about 5-15 minutes to all major touristic / vibey places on Istanbul's euro part (except, maybe, for Sultan Ahmed). Really close to Galata tower, which is perfect benchmark, you won't be lost, if your internet connection is down and cell is off.   The room is small, but cozy, we really've enjoyed staying here, nice furniture and minimal design. Well, the minus is - there's not enough electric sockets, but not critical.   Host(s) were super-friendly and polite, always up to help you with everything. If you need help, you 100% will be helped, that's super sweet!   Also, internet was fast, which is also good. I’ve seen better. This is for room 3, very small bathroom, location not that great. The positive thing to mention is water and juice in the fridge. My advice is To avoid Taksim area as a whole, not the best to stay in. Amazing home. one of the best locations in Turkey and a wonderful host The location was so good, especially for those who came to İstanbul for the first time. Hosts were welcoming and open to talk whenever I needed something. I really recommend this place. Thank you for the wonderful home and the warmth of the welcome.  Aуse quickly answered questions and helped to orientate in Istanbul.  The house is very cozy and comfortable, especially the lovely garden.  The house is close to all attractions.  It was very pleasant to live there.  I will definitely come back again. The best of everything in Istanbul…   Highly recommended… Location is great and Omar was very helpful My husband and I stayed in the apartment for 3 nights. The design was exactly like the pictures :). We traveled with car, so it was amazing that we could park in the same building for free. The communication with Beste and Bahattin was perfect with a fast response. The location is good, very close to a big mall and a lot of cafes and fast food places. For us, the only disappointment was that the apartment looks at the back yard, which was actually a concrete wall. It was a bit dark during the day. But I guess this is part of Istanbul dense construction plan :) My stay here was comfortable and enjoyable.  Room was clean, had good hygiene and  excellent location.  Kitchen covers all basics needed.  Cüneyt answered directly all concerns and in a timely fashion.  He was a very friendly host.  To sum it up in one word: a zen experience here in Istanbul ;-). location very good, contact with the host excellent, clean and nice We feeled very comfortable at the appartment. The appartment is very clean and bright and nicely decorated. You have a great view on istanbul. And one of the best points is the location. The location is directly in taksim. You Go outside and you are directly in the best Part of istanbul. Modern room, the host is very nice and friendly. Quiet at night, nothing disturbed me. Walking distance to the main attraction like the old town. Strongly recommend! A modern looking, clean and tidy house.  Tolga Bey's interest and communication is very good.  He helped me in everything.  Furniture and white goods are first quality and new.  Also suitable for long-term stay.  There are all kinds of tradesmen and shops around.  It is very easy to reach by Marmaray.  Buses and minibuses pass very close by.  You can reach Bakırköy Sahil in a short time on foot.  Thank you very much for your hospitality.  I recommend the house to everyone.  You can stay with peace of mind. Warm and nice place with a good location Location is Perfect, Self Check-in and out is great, communication was fantastic. BUT the room was smaller than the pictures show, yhe bed was 10% comfortable and was not good for rest or sleep also the belows were only two and not good at all. the room could be more clean especially the Covid situation but the host is great and I believe he'll maintain all of that.      over all the great location covered up all the down sides Very central place, flat is so nice, large bed, good kitchen equipments, comfortable  sofa and very very nice bath tub. Host, Cüneyt was very polite and kind guy, helpful and quickly answer to question. I stayed a lot of airbnb home, here is one of 5+ The best location in the city. Huge and comfortable apartment. There are everything for temporary accommodation: hair dryer, kettle, laundry. Thr apartment is in a very central location, between Sultanahmet T1 and Çemberlitaş T1 Station. The Seaview is breath taking. The washing machine us excellent and the WiFi could be faster average 20 MBit/s. We had a couple of requests for the owner for example the lighting in all rooms was dimmed and very low the owner sent an electrician who fixed the problem. The owner is very nice and he replys fast. The place is very nice and comfortable.     Amazing location and clean.   But the Team is amazing !    All the time they helpme with any detail.     I felt very safe and secure, thank you very much We had a wonderful stay at Murat’s apartment. A very cosy, stylish and super clean apartment is located in a beautiful neighborhood of Beyoglu. Murat is a very attentive host who was always in touch and helped us with all our needs, including restaurant recommendations. Check in and check out was sure easy. Will definitely come back and recommend it our friends! Great location, recommend to others. Feels like home!   We were the first guests of Betül and she did a really good job in being a host. She was very responsive to our questions and problems. Check-in was very smooth, the house was very clean and tidy. One of the best thing about the flat is the location which is very close (like 5 mins) to Taksim, Cihangir and Karaköy. Although we are very close to the center, around the flat is very cozy and quiet. The flat itself is the rooftop of the building and it provides you an AMAZING view over the bosphorus. If you are an early bird, you can see the lovely sunrise from the couch in the livingroom and listen to the seagulls. You absolutely feel like at home, you can find everything you need for longterm stays.    Thank you Betül and see you next time! :) Perfect stay    Very clean Apartmant air condition    has everything you might need , great looking compound as you stay in 5 star hotel with private beach, you can swim very comfortable for free.   A lots of restaurants and sopermarketskets under the tower and Akbati shopping mall 4 minutes walk   The host is wonderful and very professional and helpful,    Transportaion to allover Istanbul    For sure I will be back    Thank you Magdy Easy to find and easy to reach supermarket and restaurants highly recommended, place is clean, organized, it's what is shown in the pictures. near taksim square and other tourist spots nearby. Near metro too. Missy replies so fast when you need her.  She helped us find a pcr testing clinic too. Thank you again Missy. Our best Airbnb-apartment!      Everything here is perfectly comfortable, clean, stylish and thoughtful. Daniel’s apartment has two balconies on two sides of Istanbul so in the morning you can see early sunlights on Bosfor and in the evenings - breathtaking sunsets over the old city.      We will stay here at our next visit :) Great Host and place Musa is accomodating and friendly host. The place is conveniently close to taksim square. Nice and complete accomodation. Very lovely stay. The apartment had everything we were looking for. Very good location and easy communication. I recommend! It's a pleasure staying at Fatih's apt. He was fairly responsive during our communications, and even let us leave our bags for a few hours after we checked out. The apt itself is strategically located (close to public transport and convenience stores), I recommend his place for anyone visiting Istanbul and planning on spending some days near main tourist attractions. Definitely recommend  The apartment is great. It is very central and everything you need is in walking distance with many little cafés and shops and of course the galata tower. Also public transportation and all other things that you may need are very close by.  The apartment is very clean and has a nice bed and bathroom and the kitchen is fully equipped.. The Wifi is working perfectly. I follow my studies online and it never broke down or slowed down.    Fatih is a wonderful host. He always responds very quick and is a very trustful person. Overall I can highly recommend Fatih as host and the studio apartment if you want to stay in Istanbul. It's very close to Taksim square. Parking was challenging on the small alley and sometimes busy but manageable. The host was was prompt and we enjoyed our stay at his place. Would recommend if you want to be close to Taksim Square. Friendly host and very helpful Everything it was really nice Good location close to taksim but small apartment and most of the electrical devices didnt work even the A/C when I was there + several water leaks + bed broken…   Don’t book this apartment ! Location is perfect, very close to Istiklal street and Taksim. Very neat and clean room which they clean daily. 24/7 reception and they are very helpful if you need anything. Good wifi connection which was very useful.All around it was a great stay for a great value. What a lovely boutique hotel situated in a perfect spot! An incredible experience:) The location is super good and the place is a few minutes walk from taksim. there are two metro stations and bus stops a couple of streets away from the apartment, so it is very well connected with the rest of the city. The room is quite large, bright and comfortable with a direct entrance to the terrace. The rest of the apartment has everything you may need during your stay. I'm very happy to say that Rojda and Serkan are two incredible people who helped me in many things and were very kind and nice  to me at all times. I definitely recommend this place to stay in Istanbul. Perfect place to visit İstanbul.   I felt like I was living in a friends house. Everything was clean, new, cosy and useful.    I will definitely try to stay in Deniz’s apartment again, if I come to Istanbul. The apartments are located very close to the tunnel. it is very convenient. the apartment has new plumbing, a very beautiful bedroom, a comfortable bed. kitchen with dishwasher and hob. lovely large balcony! my husband and I really liked everything! Thanks for the hospitality. I was only one night in that flat but I was absolutely satisfied being there!!! The most I liked was the terrace with a big sofas and amazing view on Bosporus!!! The Appartment are very clear and comfortable, you have everything you need)) And it really has a good location to reach the most popular historical places. I definitely recommend this flat!!!!! Thank you, Cihan for your quick answers and great hospitality))! Amazing view with a very responsive host   Orhan's place has a stunning view, location is very convenient and the rooms is spacious and comfortable! Beautiful studio, very bright and good location. It is very quiet area. Beautiful view from the window.  Host was very responsive and helpful. There are plenty of shops and restaurants within a 5 minute walking distance. I highly recommend this place! Totally recommend this place!   The location is good in a quite neighborhood. The apartment is really clean, cozy with amazing lights. The place is fully equipped and will satisfy all your needs about what you may use inside the home.   Kemal as well is really a nice, kind and helpful host from the first moment until the last minute when he called the taxi for us and taking care of our luggage.   I'll be happy to visit this place again! Charming 3-bedroom house with a great private pool and beautiful garden. Very clean, well equipped. Close to Sabiha Gökçen airport and İstanbul F1 race course; supermarket about 10 minutes away by car. Perfect for a family with kids. Everything was great Cejal is an amazing person, I would definitely recommend his place Nice Place. Great location. The host was very responsive and helpful. Some of the amenities are falling appart though. Necati was great host, perfect location for all attractions; in and  around golden horn peninsula. It was delicious Turkish Coffee he tenderly offered us during checkout:) Very nice apartment, great location since it's just 3-minute walk from the Istiklal street. Hosts are very nice and helpful. The only disadvantage is that Internet disappeared from time to time, but for a short period of time. Overall it's a very good deal for such a price range! Totally I have stayed 3 months in Istanbul and I stayed here 2 months. Here is best place in Istanbul. Everythings are perfect and I want to stay more as usual residence if I have Turkish visa. In the fact, there are long term guests and repeat guests. The room was great, just enough for me. The bathroom also had everything you could possibly need, Arzu even provided shampoos which I really appreciated. The location is good, close to everything and well connected with a metro and buses. Arzu was very nice and hospitable and she provided very detailed instructions on how to get to the house and explained everything in the rules she has written around the house, which provide a better understanding between (temporary) (Hidden by Airbnb) . Thanks for everything! :) It was amazing experience! Missy is so kind and very helpful person . The apartment so cute  nice decorated and with good location , you have everything what you need for long stay       Thank so much Missy    Sure I’ll come back    See you ) Great location. Very convenient cleaning service as well Ali and his colleques are great hosts, they were really helpful and nice with us on the whole week. The place is safe, location is great, just 10 minutes from Taksim, metroline and the center is close. Our room was a bit different like it was on the pictures, it's older and needs a bit of a renovation, but otherwise it was ok. The street is a bit loud during the night but the whole neightbourhood is live and loud. It was a nice trip, totally ok the price/quality. Excellent place to stay in Istanbul! Cozy and well located.   The host was super kind! My wife and I booked a whole month at Ayşe's place and it couldn't have been more enjoyable. From the little patio outside and two large couches, the fully stocked kitchen, and the lovely neighbors and beautiful neighborhood with its history and culture, along with the many (many) cafes, our stay was one we will not soon forget. But by far the best part of our stay was the wonderful communication we had with Ayşe the entire way, she truly made our stay memorable. If you are looking for a short little getaway or a longer stay, I highly recommend Ayşe's place. Awesome host! very helpfull Thanks for everything I spent three months here and I could not have hoped for a better place to end up. Mehmet and Furkan are great guys and their apartment is very cosy. I immediately felt at home and shared some great moments with them. I can sincerely say that they have become good friends. I recommend this place to everyone who is looking for a temporary home in Istanbul while experiencing Turkish hospitality first-hand. Stays like these are what AirBnb was originally founded for. Eyvallah my friends  ! The host and the place both was amazing. The place it’s very comfortable and it’s feels like home highly recommended. Area it great. And the Tv it’s amazing  Perfect location in the heart of Beyoglu neighborhood in Istanbul, on a quiet street but super close to everything in the area. A few minutes walk to Galata Tower, Istiklal Street and tram to the historic sites. Apartment just as pictured, modern architectural designer touches, very comfortable beds, modern showers, well equipped kitchen. Beautiful view of the church from the window. The host is very responsive and helpful, answered questions and provided recommendations promptly. He also arranged airport transfer for us and met us at the apartment  - check in and check out was very easy. Fully recommend this Istanbul gem. very good location Liane’a place is very charming and has everything you need for an excellent stay. The Bahçesehir Park is walking distance, and is full of restaurants, playgrounds and a beautiful lake. You can relax, enjoy a picnic, or just watch the view.   For those with a car, the access to downtown may be a bit easier, as the bus takes a while to reach the closest metro station.    Liane is a great host and we had a very good stay at her flat!   Thanks again! Great hospitality. Would come back again definitely! The apartment is pretty good for the price. Location is perfect. There were some issues, but the host was responsive, and fixed it really fast. Recommend this place  lovely apartment, restaurants and shops close by. Unfortunately pool was closed Awesome host, very helpful. Went out of his way to make us feel comfortable. Room spacious and clean. Hotel in a good location.  There is street noise as the room faces the road with alot of cafes in the area. We did not mind as we love the area so much. Overall, we were so pleased with our stay we booked a few more days again. Thanks to all the staff at Ansen. You all are amazing! We really enjoyed our stay, everything was so clean and accessible and we would especially like to thank Eziz for his help and service, he honestly made the stay so much more relaxing and helped us with everything. Great Location, beautiful apartment.    Definitely recommend for longer trips!        Beautiful view and street!       Will definitely consider staying again! Great location, the staff is super friendly and helpful. The sauna and the hammam was a great experience. Some noise during the day due to constructions nearby, but this should end pretty soon. Great location! Host was very attentive! Definitely would stay here again! Quiet and safe residential area, recommended for long trips. the host was very helpful and answer to all our additional requests promptly, and communication is great Great place to stay, super location... Quite yet within walking distance of many attraction. The host Murat was very helpful. I would highly recommend a stay here. Great place Very good location, good host! Everything was perfect! Thanks This place was everything I need for my family trip to Istanbul. We had to make a last moment reservation since the previous place I reserved was not up to my standard. Can and his management team made sure we could check in fast and easy. Apartment has everything you need to stay there for extended period of time: kitchen, laundry, tv, etc. Most important thing - everything was clean and relatively new. I will recommend this place to all of my friends. Thank you! Very good service and clean place I am happy to meet Rasit. He is friendly and always ready to help.   I feel like home. It was a very nice trip and a good time. This was with no doubt my worst airbnb experience. From the first moment we checked in all was bad. We had informed Ira of our exact arrival time, and we really arrived at the apartment 10 minutes after the time we had said. After a long flight from the US to Turkey I really didn't expect nobody would be expecting us at the apartment! We waited for some time, and nobody showed up. So I activated my US chip, which wasn't of course free, and just after I texted her she said oh my friend will come and bring you the keys in just five minutes! It took at least 30 more minutes! She later said it's the first time something like this happened, put the blame on us for not answering the messages she had sent in the hours prior to our arrival (which we were in an international flight, so of course we didn't have internet and couldn't answer).    This was just the beginning. The apartment didn't look at all like photos. The photos show a carpet in the living room, cushions on the sofa, books in the shelves, some decent bedding. Neither of these were there. The bed itself didn't even have sheets on them. There was a very thin mattress protector, and a duvet cover which wasn't long enough to cover the whole bed, but no sheets! So we had to buy ours. The apartment was extremely hot, so much that it was impossible to sleep during night. We were sure to check the apartment has an air conditioning, and we thought it did, but it didn't! She said it wasn't listing at all, so for this I blame ourselves, perhaps we made a mistake thinking it did have. But I asked her if she could at least give us an extra ventilator, and she just said no!   The bedroom is too tiny, no closet anywhere! We had to use the book-shelves which was empty of any books to put our belongings. This apartment in on the first floor so if the windows are open which for the heat they had to be open all the time, then you felt like you're already on the street! The street is terribly noisy, people gather like at the bottom of the building to chat and smoke cigarettes all the time, an I had to breathe the terrible smoke all day long!    We would have been just fine with all these things if she didn't do what she did after a few days. She texted us to say she's selling the apartment and need to show it to some possible buyers. We said ok. Then she said we can't be inside the apartment when she shows it to them, as it's illegal to do airbnb in Turkey and her realtor shouldn't know about this! We said we aren't fine with this, since she was insisting it had to be at 2pm, and it's extremely hot during that time of the day, and we had no other place to go. This was specially very problematic since we were working remotely from the apartment (it was supposed to be a one month long trip). So we said we can't do this, and ask her to change the date or at least hour of her appointment! she said she can't! So we had to leave the place with all our belongings, laptops, tablets, all documents, everything precious we needed to work with, since of course we didn't trust either her or the people we didn't know who wanted to visit the place. This made us feel very uncomfortable and unsafe in that place, she practically threw us out of the apartment during day! So we decided we had enough of that. We wrote to the airbnb support, and then left the place, and put the key inside. We didn't want to do anything with her anymore. And then when I wrote her to say that she made us feel bad and so we left the apartment, she cursed me and said I should be ashamed of myself for doing this. JUST KEEP AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! and to Ira, you might be a nice person or not, I didn't have the chance to communicate with you to know, but after more that 30 airbnb experiences in many different countries around the world I can just tell you what you did wan't right at all! Nothing about the way you hosted us was right! Instead of blaming it on your guests just accept your mistakes and apologize!!! Good place to stay. A very good friend. Very charming space, better than photos and so near to taksim Square . Ali takes care of everything, even i arrive so late he Will arrange to welcome me. And also he arranged me a taxi to go to airport. Extremely Clean House and very nice garden. Dont doubt to book the place this apartmentis perfect for a short stay!  the locationis is the best. You have tram and metro in 2 minutes walk. All the cafes are nearby! Apartment also has a coffee pot  and everything you need. Nour's apartment is spacious and very good located in the city. Her hospitality and communication skills are great. Her house and kitchen have everything you might need. The apartment is in safe and wonderfull alley, just 5 minutes walk to Istiklal street. I would definetly recommend her place for everyone want to enjoy the great Istanbul. We enjoyed the live music down in the alley.. we stayed for one week and the place kept in my mind like a piece of a movie. Obada's Place is amazing. it's very well located, it's in the best area in Kadikoy, in a famous street for Cafes, you can walk some minutes to Moda, or to Bar street.  walk 8 min to the ferry station, 5 min to the Airport Bus. furthermore, it's less than 5 min walking to Marmary metro which can take you directly to the other side,  and around 20 min to Taksim,  you can also walk 12 min to Metrobus. It's Perfectly located.    the falt itself is big, quiet, clean, well equipped and have a huge terrace, you can spend hours on the terrace without feeling bored, the terrace is ready for BBQ. and surrounded by nice cafes where you can have a good breakfast.    Obada is a cool guy, helpful, friendly, ready to support, and you can have a a good time with him,  whether it's a deep conversation or bla bla chat, hanging out with him is an advantage, he knows all the cool stuff in the city. The place was great, great location very convenient, it was clean and comfortable and the communication was very easy and helpful efficient. I totally recommend this airbnb! If you want to be near istiklal street and galata tower and karakoy it’s the best location because everything is 10 minutes walking. Also 5 mins to metro and tramway.    The room was very clean and most of the things you might need is there.   The welcome snacks were much appreciated after long drive from airport    Thank you for letting us stay and enjoy an amazing experience. My stay was perfect. The room was clean, tidy and it has everything you need. The atmosphere there is great.    Two two guy in the reception, Parvin and the other guy, were very friendly and always ready to help you with any question you have about the city or how to move around.    I hardly recommend this place.    Thank you for everything. Awesome place, awesome location. Ziver is a very punctual host, very fast and easy to communicate with. We stayed for a small week and it was the perfect place to explore the city from! i highly recommend this place. it is exactly the same as shown in pictures unlike all other bad expeirence i have . i highly recommend this place to all visitors to istanbul. the liliya and ramazan is outstanding and they know what is meant by hospitality. they would help you around the clock. no matter how far they have to go. appreciate your help guys. best of luck Everything was perfect, the apartment is in a great location, very comfortable, clean and pleasant. The decoration is very nice. I hope to return there on a future trip to Istanbul.   Thank you very much for Faruk, for his reactivity during our discussions, and for the simplicity of coming to the apartment.   Séverine and Erdal It was one of the cleanest flat we’ve been. Thanks for hospitality and help. Recommended!! House is clean and well equipped then cozy. And it located in nice place near beach and restraunts :) highly recommanded We stayed at elvan’s house for 2 days and she was very kind to us. She is very easy to communicate with and she cares about the comfort of your stay. The house was very clean and the cat was very cute. Highly recommended! best host, and best location , it was our first apartment that we stayed at in Istanbul and sadky we couldn't stay more, we had the best stay as a couple , we totally recommend this apartment , it will give you comfort , and nice view to the sea, best clean apartment we had ever tried in Istanbul and fadilitated with everything you can need , my wife loved it and the host is available and concerned with all your needs, supper supper host, we will come again and again Great host, great apartment! Great host, good central location, nice apartment, wonderful sea view.  Everything was great, the place is highly recommended. One of my best Airbnb experiences. Ali was a super helpful and friendly host, very nice to talk to and available for any questions or tips for anyone completely new to the city. His flat is in a very convenient location too, so cafes, bars, and tourist sites are all easily accessible by foot and/or public transport. Would definitely recommend Great location for my business appointment on this trip This was my first trip to Istanbul, and I was lucky to pick a flat that was both very safe and comfortable and offered great access to all parts of the city.    The flat is a very clean, cozy one bedroom at the top floor of a building about 2 minutes from Taksim square. Being in the top floor, I didn't need to deal with noises from above which always annoy me. It's pretty quiet considering it is at the center of the city. There's no lift, so you have to climb the stairs to the top; it's the 4th/5th floor. I didn't mind it since I come from a very sedentary lifestyle, so I needed that extra calories burnt :)   My fiance and I stayed at the flat for 15 days and we found in there everything we needed. There was literally nothing missing, and yes we cooked several times. The kitchen is fully equipped, and if anything was needed our host Berna offered to provide it though we never got to that point.     The flat is very clean; I loved the shower and its pressure, better than what I have at home. The bed was very comfortable, and we hung out a lot on the very comfy couch in the living room. You also have access to two terraces that offer nice view of the neighborhood.    The place is about 2 minutes walking distance to the Taksim square, a bit of an uphill though but I didn't mind it at all.    A great thing about the place is that you have access to EVERYTHING within less than a minute of walking: supermarkets, fruit shops, professional laundry services if you need, butcher shop, coffee shop, restaurants, etc. We didn't even need to walk to Taksim square to get stuff if we needed something in the unit. Just want down and fetched it from one of the stores by the apartment.    All public transportations are within a few minutes of walking distance from the flat. We could walk 3-5 minutes to get to the bus, metro station, tramway, the tour buses, etc. which allowed us to explore all parts of Istanbul, Asia and Europe. Staying at Berna's flat you won't need taxi.    Last but not least, Berna our host: she is a great host. She left us water and chocolates in the flat when we got there. She was available all the time for any questions or help, whether about the flat or the city. We communicated through text, and she'd respond within less than a minute.    Overall, during our 15 day stay there was absolutely no issues we encountered with the flat or the host. We both absolutely loved it and had a great time.    I highly recommend this place to any person, or couple who's visiting Istanbul, especially if it is your first time.    Thank you Berna! Cihan’s apartment is a nice place to stay both for short and long trip - it has all the amenities needed and is located in a great place (metro station is really close and lively Istiklal street is just a couple blocks away; also, due to nice planning, bedroom is pretty quiet (according to Istanbul standards)). Cihan himself is a great host and is always available and ready to help with anything. Overall, it’s a great value for money & the possibility to stay in a nice neighborhood close to some of the major attractions! Tao & Hilal are great hosts, ready to help with everything at any moment. Apt is really cozy and stylish, but because of stairs, it's not perfect for guests with infants as it was in our case. But if your are the company of young people, you'll enjoy for sure. Can recommend and give 5* Everything was perfect. We will come here again for long stay. Thank you for everything. Ferhat property is very nice, there are 4 spacious room that can accommodate us to stay. The chic and trendy design made our stay much better. For sure it is also added with the great hospitality of Ferhat, he helped us for airport transfer, we tried the foods in his restaurant too. I’ll be back for sure! The apartment has the best location: walking distance to the main sights of Sultanahmet and Istiklal Avenue. It’s also possible to see the Galata Tower from two of the bedrooms. In addition to the great location, we were very pleased with the place, it was spacious, the beds were comfortable, everything worked and it was very clean. Sebastian is an amazing host, very attentive and goes out of his way to help. This apartment is awesome! I confirm why Memet is a super host. Place is so clean, comfortable and even has a great artistic touch. Memet is so kind, and thinks what could be useful for guest before guest thinks about it jajajaja. I'll reccomend this place to all my friends who want to come to Istanbul, indeed. Very relaxing place with amazing view.   Totally recommend. Everything  was good. The room is clean and stylish. Great location. Great stay! Handan was a great host and she was always ready to help. The apartment was very cosy, beautiful, well decorated, clean, easy check in and out and located near Taksim Square, with taxis, metro and bus stations.  I recommend this apartment,  if I want to visit Istanbul again, I'll definitely choose it. Highly recommended, thank Handan. it was a pleasant experience for the value. Omer was very communicative as a host. He is a great host, very helpful. Clean flat, nice location, good amenities. Akın is very good and helpful. He is always trying to help and make you feel comfortable I really enjoyed my stay at House Mola! You will feel very welcome from the beginning.   From my opinion this is the best area for your stay in Istanbul, very central. I did everything by foot (except to go to Asian side of course). The room is very nice and looks just like the picture.   I would definitely book this room again! We had a wonderful stay at Dev’s place. We were sad to leave, truly felt like home Absolutely incredible stay! Ihsan very helpful and the place is very neat and clean, location is very good. I recommend it. cozy, clean, comfortable place. We stayedfor 2 nights and feeled ourselves relaxing in the house. Great location and great deal. Walking distance from Taksim, foods, grocery stores and shopping center (1 min to be precise). There was a beautiful balcony in the room we stayed in. It was nice to sit outside and chill. The bed wasn’t the most comfortable bed but with all the walking I did in Istanbul I just passed out easily but my sister said her sleep wasn’t the best.       Just so you are aware it’s a shared space so you will be sharing the kitchen and bathroom. Free breakfast is included which is nice. The host and his wife are both sweet and helpful. So are the workers and the breakfast chef. Also the cleaning lady was so sweet. I didn’t get her name but she was so welcoming. The place was under construction when I stayed, but everything was available except hot water. The owner informed me the day I arrived, so it wasn’t a big deal. I’m sure once they complete the rest of the construction the place will look magnificent and everything including hot water will be working. I did stay at another one of his property and it was brand new renovated and clean. So I’m looking forward to see what it looks like after construction. I will definitely recommend and will surely come back. Absolutely perfect. Clean, well-equipped studio. Easy communications. All recommendations. My favorite place to staying in Istanbul - perfect location on çemberlitaş, 3 minutes to tram) Stylish design, comfortable accomadation and very hospitality stuff. Very welcoming owner, gave me some use advice about nearest area.   Hold on almost all time. Responds quickly.   The flat exceeded my expectations:   Clean, roomy, nice furniture. There’s everything you need for a comfortable stay.   So amazing view from balcony    A little bit noisy from nearest club, but it wasn’t problem for me, I used the earplug.   Very convenient location.   I’m glad, that I choose this place. The location of the apartment is very convenient to get to the tram/bus/metro station, it's very close to the sea and to the Sultanahmet major sights. There are also a lot of small shops around.     The flat is actually nice: there are all necessary things for comfortable stay. There is proper air conditioning inside which is very good in summer. But it seems to be not so clean as I expected, which was a bit bothering.    But Sermir was very hospitable and ready to help with just anything I needed, which is very great)) It made my stay in Istanbul very comfortable and safe. The check in and check out was also very convenient - thank you so much! Such an amazing place. I loved it and will definitely recommend it. The host and her apartment are super good! It’s one of the best places to stay in Istanbul. Many thanks to Nelly for her hospitality and understanding. Highly recommend! It’s a super clean apartment, sanitized before our arrival. Very large and well located across the Galata Tower with a stunning view. Well equipped, comfortable, as good as the photos and had everything we needed. Overall great place to stay, highly recommended, I’ll be happy to come again. Good stay, very helpful staff It was an excellent experience. Everything was just perfect, will be back soon. :) Dodo is an amazung host, his communication was outstanding. He gave a package of information before arrivle which has alot of information about apartment and places to visit in istanbul.    The day we had to check in he  came in persin and explained in detail everything on apartment. Then he gave us a tour around neighborhood and gave every drtail about transportation and restaurants. His apartment us in amazing location close to everyhing stores, restaurants and transportation. Very clean apartment has all you need in kitchen. Also if you have any question he will answer very quick.   Definitely coming back to his apartment and i have told all family and freind about his hospitality. Thank you we really enjoyed our stay. An excellent experience!      My husband and I spent 3 weeks in Istanbul and we are sure that we stayed in the best hotel. It is new, comfy and clean, with fast and reliable internet, daily cleaning service, nice breakfasts. The management is super kind, polite, responsive, caring and ready to help you with anything. Arda and Murat really became our good friends during our stay at Castle Franco Suites!      The location is really great: all touristic places around Sultanahmet Square, Grand Bazaar, Egyptian Bazaar, Eminönü Ferry Docks, Galata Bridge are in a walkable distance. To the rest places-to-see you can get either on taxi, or on the tram (and the tram station is literally above the corner from the hotel). There is a mosque across the street, but it's not super loud and was never waking us up in the morning.      Zack and I are super happy that we chose this hotel in Istanbul, and we will stay here during our next trip to this city for sure! Nice apartment, well located, it`s such an industrial area, but it`s pretty close to Metro Station, easy access to Galata Tower, Taksim, Grand Bazaar, etc.      Anil and Aysu are very kind and we had good communication along all my stay Simple yet cosy flat, very close to Galata.   Akif is very friendly and helpful person had to wait our late arrival due to plane delay, but still was cheerfull. Wifi is good. We got everything as expected and can recommend this flat for simple people traveling with just with backpacks as we did.   Note: if you have heavy bags or small kids it may be troublesome to get to appartment due to high stairs in this historical building I would definitely recommend this AirBnB, it's exactly as shown in photos! Excellent Wi-Fi, very convenient location, and hosts were very responsive. The heating and water pressure was great as well. Enjoyed my stay here 100%! Great location Really good place really good host! This house is very nice and in a great location. There are few coffee shops, restaurants and markets in a few steps away. 5-10 min walk from Taksim. We had some problems with heating and Bulent helped to solve it asap. Internet, TV - Netflix is on board... The neighbourhood is outstanding and Hamit did everything in order to provide a comfortable experience for us.      You’ll have all the amenities for a nice stay for one or two weeks, even longer, if you want.      Go for this apartment if you have strong young legs and okay with an apartment being a bit small.  Was good, but needs some small fixes (kitchen pans, better bed sheets) to be more comfortable. The perfect place for a short to medium stays!      I stayed In Orbay’s apartment for 9 days and it was perfectly what I needed.      The place has everything you need! All pots and pans for cooking, and a table that can be used for working also (not very comfy tho). But keep in mind the room is a bit tiny (3x5 meters) roughly!      The place is literally 4 minutes away from the beach, and let me tell you, the beach, is, spectacular!! It’s not a swimming beach tho, it’s perfect for picnics and runs!      3 minutes away from the apartment is all the stores you would ever need! Literally the street has everything, groceries, local veggies shops, pharmacies, atm, tobacco shops, etc.      Bus stop is also a 3 minutes walk (Very close).      The one thing i hated the most is how hot this apartment can get! Literally checked in during the worst summer days, and it was a sauna! Good thing the weather got much better after a couple of days.      Balcony is very nice, but keep in mind it’s shared by the building (2 other apartments) which they rarely use, but they still do.      The neighborhood is very safe, and not at all touristy, which is exactly what i needed! I used to come back at night, and the streets are well lit, and safe!      All in all, the stay was great! And it’s the best bang for your buck! About the host, he was very polite and attentive to my needs. He even got me food when I arrived because I asked where to buy grocery. The apartment is situated on a hill, in a conservative neighborhood in Istanbul. Neighbors are friendly and eager to help if asking for help. There are tones of supermarkets and restaurants in the vicinity. From the apartment to Yildiztabya bus station there’s 7-8 minutes walk and to get to the main road there is a sharp high hill you need to climb. The WIFI was strong. The main drawback about this place is its distance to main parts of city such as Taksim, Eminunu and other central part of Istanbul. During the daytime with traffic getting from this place to Eminunu can take about 1 hour or more and to Taksim 50 minutes to one hour depending on traffic. I believe considering the apartment location and long commute time, the rent is overpriced. Apartment is bright and cosy, though a bit smaller than on the pics.  Yildray promptly provided all neccesary information for use of the utilities and allows to leave luggage for some hours after check out. View from the window is nice. Location is good, but if you travel with a baby or big luggage be ready to go up/down from the hill each time. Ilhan and Taha were super friendly and helpful with all requests we had. No matter what time or day the did answer and help. Super service. Super save area with nice foot shopping possibilities. Also me walking around as a women on my own felt super save. 15 min walk to Galata tower. If you like to be in the city center. This is the place. we really love the apartment Lisya’s place was amazing. The view was unbeatable. From the bedroom, the living room, and also the 10th floor terrace. The windows are floor to ceiling and you get to see all of the city! The flat was clean and had everything we needed. Check in was very smooth and Lisya was very responsive. The location is great too- close to lots of restaurants and shops and very cheap and short taxi ride to Sultanahmed The hotel is literally an 8 mn walk up a steep hill to the Grand Bazzar. Another 10mns and you're at Hagia Sophia and The Blue Mosque. Public transportation is also right up at that same hill. Location was great. I even loved walking through the street where the hotel is situated and seeing all the locals eating at small eateries along the way. The staff was the best! Super nice and so helpful. I was having problems getting a taxi and the owner of the hotel actually took the time to drive me himself to my destination!!! The terrace where you have breakfast is so beautiful and picturesque and the breakfast was great too! The rooms are very simple but i wasnt there for that. The location is great! Right in the middle of the Old town Istanbul and you definitely got that feel. Id totally stay there again :) Very nice flat, big and lightful, near to everything. Good stay for a short trip Everything was fine!! Very good location! Highly recommended We enjoyed our time in this place. The location is very convenient and the studio apartment has everything you need for a long stay. The communication was great and prompt. We won’t hesitate booking this place again.       Thank you for hosting us! Mahsa is a very kind and responcsive host. I recommend a lot. Our trip was awsome and the location of the appartment is great. Aziz such a friendly person and responds quickly when you need something. His apartment is clean and exactly what the pictures look like. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in this area!) Perfect ! I recommend This place is cozy, clean and nice. We spent there 5 nights and everything was perfect. Apartment is ideal for 2 people to stay. There’s a good workplace with wonderful view of the street and comfortable bed to have a rest after long walking hours. The neighborhood is lovely and you can choose a lot of restaurants to spend time at. Apartment is just a minute away from Galata tower, there are a lot of tourists, but it is very quite at night though. Very nice located, super clean and nice apartment. everything was just perfect. i will come again. Great location and close to many attraction in the area and public transportation. Nice and clean apartment, very cozy and enough space,  even provided mask which was thoughtful. Response was quick with anything we needed.  The only problem is the next door had construction building a full building. We couldn't sleep because of the noise from Seagulls and the very early workers. Other than that, it's a great place. Will be back next time and hoping no more construction around the same building. Good located apartments! Clean and comfortable. Everything was Perfect also the view from the roof was Awesome with great neighborhood !   I love this place ❤️ Host did not answer and the place is temporary closed could not check in One of the best place to stay, very clean and comfortable, walking distance to Taksim square where you will have a lot of fun..   Yasmin is supper nice lady, she is very kind and supportive.   I am sure you will love the residence and neighborhood.   I will never hesitate to stay here whenever i am visiting Istanbul Very well priced and in a very good and central location. the apartments are  close to food, tourist attractions, shopping centers and bars.    Very stylish interior throughout the building with a comfortable terrace with kitchen free to use at any time.   best part was that the manager was always available 24/7 no matter what I needed.   10/10 experience. The apartment is relatively accurate to the pictures. It has all the amenities you need for a short stay. The staff are very understanding and helpful. Also it has a beautiful view of the ocean from the window. I loved this place since it's very comfortable and also you can enjoy the swimming pool with sauna.   it was about 20 minutes walkit distance to Taksim main street, we did enjy the walk. Mehmet is great person and manager. He is always willing to help. The place it's really at best location possible!!   This is going to be my place in Istanbul for future!! Second visit second pleasure 10/10 approve! Very nice location in Kadikoy,you can go anywhere from there really!Ziver also make possible for me to get in the apartment after my late arrival! Great location , good value of money , clean . Highly recommended. The host is really a good person, responsive and supporting. good location. quiet and pratical apartment. perfect to get to know istambul as it is close to taksim square. good comunication and check out time flexible. totally recomend l We had a 2 week stay in this apartment in the second half of October.       The place was very nice and clean, cozy and warm even though we visited in a cold period of the year. We also appreciated the fact that's fully equipped with plenty of dishes, cutlery, pots and pans so we could use new plates and cutlery until the dishwasher was full.       The TV was big, the wifi was quick and stable. The two bathrooms were very nice to have for us.       Communication was great, we got videos explains how to arrive to the place, Mehmet and the nice people at Missafir replied very quickly to our comments. They also accommodated for our unusual check-in and check-out times.       The location is great, close to Kabatas and Taksim so walking distance to metro, trams and ferries to reach many tourist places in Istanbul. But the only small inconvenience was that it's located on a steep hill so for people with a pram for example it might be a bit of a hassle.       I fully recommend this apartment, it was a great stay and when we come back to Istanbul, we'll definitely try to stay at the same place. Erden is quick to respond, his place is very clean and inexpensive, good for a couple. But I think he’ll have air conditioning soon. Nice host. ==Hosts==   Before we arrived their communication with us was really good, they were always in contact and guide us for the transportation from the airport. Additionally, they picked us from the meeting point and take us home by taxi. Gulsin and her family were always ready to help since they are living on the second floor of the place. They were keeping in touch with us with a message to be sure everything is okey. Even one of the night it was so cold, they informed us that they activated the heater before we say anything. (don't trust weather it can be cold in June too :)) They brought us delicious Turkish dishes! We are really appreciated their hospitality and friendship.        ==Location==   The location is amazing and peaceful. There is a great walking road through the forest starting just outside the house. It is peaceful both during the day and the night. Perfect for relaxing.   The place is 20 minutes from the port uphill by walk and it is a steep climb. There is transport to get to the house.       ==Place==   There are two rooms with living room/kitchen being separate from bedroom. There is enough space to comfortably work and sleep if needed. In the kitchen there is enough tools to cook most meals and prepare good dishes.   The bathroom is small and there is barely enough space to take a shower or stand. But it is manageable and neglectable when all the other conditions(rest of the place, host, location and price) were considered.      With all the things that we mentioned, we enjoyed our holiday a lot there and everything was so peaceful. Thank you Gulsin and her family for everything :) These guys are great. They are so helpful and supportive. They checked in with us via (Hidden by Airbnb) a few times and due to delays happily came and found us on arrival at 2am. To be advised the place is split over two floors and are totally separate units, which is fine just need to be aware you’ll need to go between to each others rooms. The terrace is great! The doors are a bit tricky so ensure you get Merve & Ahmet to teach you about how to lock/open the doors when you check in. Ultimately it was decent place, quirky and cool, decent value and a great terrace, which is the main selling point! Great place, affordable and clean. Selinnur is a kind and helpful host. very recommend ✨ clean The place has a great location very easy to access, clean with such a great value. Berna responded quickly with all needed information in details. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.    Thanks Berna. No doubt your most significant memory from staying in this apartment will be the view.  In the evenings you can open the windows and listen to the calls for prayer wafting over this ancient city, exotic  sounds punctuated by the horns of passing ships.   And in the mornings having coffee looking out on the Bosporus.  You will find nearby restaurants, small grocery markets, coffee shops and a pharmacy.  And Taksim Square within walking distance, albeit up a steep hill.  We spent a week here and throughly enjoyed our stay. The owner arranged a van for airport pickup and departure.  Very nice shower and also has dishwasher, wash machine, stove and oven.  I highly recommend this apartment. Ozgur was a great host, provided us with everything we asked for. Ozgur response time was perfect. Apartment was clean and spacious, as you see in the pictures. You pay for what you get. Furniture was new and good quality. Could not ask for a better host, apartment and location. Thank you once again Ozgur for making my Istanbul experience as great as it was. The place is great, good amenities, best location, good host and good price If you are looking for a centrally located, secure, clean, and safe apartment stay, this is the location I recommend. The office manager goes above and beyond to ensure your stay goes well, including making recommendations on local places to visit. I had a wonderful stay in Istanbul and would gladly book this property again! We stayed in this apartment for 2 weeks, 4 adults working remotely - wifi connection is really great.    We loved the flat and the district, everything was great. There’s a room for children but the bed there is big enough for a tall person.    Thanks a lot for a wonderful place to stay! What an incredibly lovely place to stay for a week in Istanbul! Perfectly situated so close to Galata Tower but on a cute side street away from most of the tourist traffic. The apartment has everything you need, including a dreamy reading nook and great wifi for remote working. Don't hesitate to book! I feel so lucky.       Booked this place because our itinerary changed last minute. Mert had the place ready in an hour.       Wifi was fast and stable. There aren’t any mosques around, so no noise interrupted my meetings or woke us up. Fast enough where I can watch Netflix and my wife make a FaceTime call.      It was very clean and has everything we needed. It is located in the middle of EVERYTHING. You can try a new restaurant every day without walking more than a couple blocks. Most shop keepers & restaurants spoke English. Metro is a few blocks away. Very chic stores close by.      There are 2 air conditioners to help battle the heat. It looks exactly like the pictures! Excellent decor and nice view of the street.      There is a door that separates the the living room from the hallway that leads to the 2 bed rooms, so I could watch TV while my wife was asleep. Mattress was comfortable. Washing machine just made life easier.      Above all else, I needed something and he was ready to come help and answers his phone immediately. Very nice gentleman.      You will not regret your decision to stay here. I will try to stay here every time I’m in the city. Room is big and comfortable. 3 min walk to the central square Taxim. Lots of food options around. recommend Good receptions and hospitality . A great place and very close to the Mall of Istanbul. Loved the location and the private terrace right next to Galata. Perfect setting. A very good hotel, everything clean, the standard of room similar to one I met in 5-star hotel, good communication with the staff in English (although as I haven't really had big issues with anything then I don't know how with more complex topics).      The only real issue was that as a tall person (185cm) the shower was too low for me, but if you are not so tall it should be perfect :) Jelena was super friendly and helpful. Whenever we wanted any recommendation or any information, she was there to help.      We stayed for a month at the apartment and it was very suitable for long stays from all the aspects. The internet was perfect and very fast for remote works and you can find anything you want in all the apartment facilities.      The location was good since it's five minutes away from Taksim. Everything was completely great. Flat is cozy, clean and comfortable. Owner is always ready to help. Highly recomended flat if you are visit Istanbul Hikmet is a great and very helpful host. The apt can be better. Maybe towels and sheets can be upgraded to newer and better ones ... We had a lovely time during our stay at Salih place, the view is astonishing and impressive and the host was very helpful and always available to answer your questions. you need to be aware that the apartment is on high floor (6th floor) and there is no elevator. in our case, we were lucky enough to get some help in carrying our luggage. Great location for its value   Nice and stylish This was my first experience using Airbnb in Turkey; in Mustafa's apartment I really felt like home..      Mustafa is a very helpful, friendly and professional host...he helped me with many things and gave me a lot of convenient tips      The apartment is very clean and well-equipped (everything is available)      The room is just like in the pictures...comfortable and clean      The neighbourhood is safe, with everything nearby...Metro bus, bus stations are about 10 min away      I have no complaints..      If I happened to  visit Turkey again, I will definitely book in Mustafa's apartment again (if available)      Thank you Mustafa for everything :) absolutely everything was perfect.   Everything was great from check in to our departure. Room was fantastic, the staff were brilliant and very helpful considering the covid 19 restrictions. The hygiene and sanitation was excellen. Bed was so comfortableThis hotel is worth every penny, we were absolutely blown away by everything. the security was amazing only people with the key card have access to the hotel front door. if you are looking for a place to stay in Istanbul this is the perfect place it's in the middle of all the attentions . i can't even praise the staff enough on how helpful the were the host responded to our messages within minutes all the time. Definitely worth another visit soon The location is super good but apartment is small, fit for me. One thing abt my concern is check in process must be easier to tell the traveler at the first but they are clueless and didnt give the detail after booking. So we have to activate asking, my time was unlucky bcs its rain outsode while ive no internet and really struggling how to get in the building, to know the unit or any other info. You better provide complete information after someone book your place.      Also they have washing machine which we have to share, sometimes its free but someone just leave it finish and we have no idea how. The stairs is quite dangerous so be careful.      After all, thats good with that price. Best flat, everything you need is in this flat, location is very good, we used metro(kadikoy) or ferry to get to another part of Istanbul. It takes walking only 5-6 min from flat.    So I want to convey a huge thank you to the host!    Kadikoy is a good place for living or touristic goals. Near the flat a lot of shops, cafes, transports, a market with vegetables, fishes, tourist souvenirs. The room is very light, I woke up in good mood. And the flat is large. the most beautiful spot i’ve stayed in the city!   picturesque view overlooking the old city, light and clean room, perfect for solo and couples stay.   Owner Ugur was extremely attentive and welcoming.   would definitely stay again if i have a chance. Great host, great apt. Terrace is better than photos. We lived in this apartment for 35 days. My wife and I liked everything.   1. The location of this house is just perfect.   2. The house itself is very cozy and comfortable.   3. Ege is a great person. We are very glad that we have chosen this apartment and I recommend this apartment to everyone. The house is spotlessly clean. I like that there was washing powder and cleaning detergents. This is my priority and I appreciated this.       Also some snacks and amenities were there.       the location is okay if you are used to istanbul. my father suddenly decided to come with me so it was his first time hence it was bit tiring to go back and forth to the European side        there is a station though that directly connects you to the European side.       I would stay again by myself since am used to visiting Turkey but wouldn't bring someone for a first time in this area       Thank you for having us  Great place to stay in , if you love crowded and local places in istanbul then this is the place for you!!    Close to many other areas that u can reach by either walking or easy transportation !   And super cozy place with cute balcony Highly recommend this place. The view is incredible! The host is really polite and available. Very cozy appartment for short and long stays. Located in a very convenient location with corner shops on its doorstep. However no air-conditioning therefore can get a little hot. The host did kindly provide 2 fans at our request. Otherwise clean new and Host was always 1 message away. Would highly recommend. the place is really central and Tuğçe is a very friendly and sweet person. it was a very lovely stay with respect for privacy, a cute cat and good tips for the time in Istanbul. thank you a lot and hopefully we will meet again. ☺️ good location. grocery nearby. a bit tough to get in with luggage because of 2 difficult staircases. Aytunc apartment is the best apartment we stayed in when in Istanbul. We reserved the apartment for two months, the first month was in the summer and the apartment did not have air conditioning which what Aytunc had described in the list but we did not notice. We requested an air conditioning and he did not hesitate to provide one so the apartment now have air conditioning . We were a family of four with two kids, and everyone in the family loved the place and it was big and very spacey for kids to play and be comfortable. There’s also a parking space and a patio and is located on first floor. The area of the apartment is close to the metro and to a big mall and also a lot of cafes and restaurant. Shops are just down the streets and we enjoyed that a lot. Aytunc place made our stay in Istanbul so much better and easier. I highly recommend this place. Once I am back to Istanbul again I am reserving this apartment. Türkhun was an amazing host! Honestly, he was very helpful, accommodating and willing to assist you with anything to make you enjoy and have a good stay at his place. His place is like 1 min from Galata tower, very close to many shops and restaurants. Very clean. Most importantly the kitchen has a very complete cooking tools, cutleries, plates and even Turkish coffee and tea makers. Such an amazing flat. The best view in Istanbul!! Host was super sweet and friendly. Overall, it was a really nice experience to stay here, the house was very spacious and comfortable. Everything was perfect. Good place to stay! The apartment was very comfortable and spacious. It was very well quipped making good for a long stay. The location was close to the main Istiklal street yet it was a quiet street next to a park. Thank you Sabah for being one of the kindest hosts. And thank you for checking in and making easy to communicate with you. I would love to stay here again! Recommended! very nice place with a great location. hosts were always there to help :) There’s no shampoo or shower gel, you need to bring them with you. great communication, great location. host was super friendly and helpful.  10 on 10! If you want a home that truly gives you the feel of living in an authentic Turkish neighbourhood, this is the place. I cannot say enough to recommend the charming and stylish space that Asu has created. I especially appreciated her balcony, which is a space where a writer could sit for hours and work on their next book. We also loved the living room, which is a perfect place to play a game of chess or read a book, by the balcony. A curious, interesting feature about this home is that it’s built on a slope… So, the entrance is underground, but the balcony is one or two floors above the ground. For me this added to the home’s unique charm.      Asu had also put in many personal touches to make us welcome. There were chocolates. But we thought the white lilies were especially beautiful.      Enough cannot be said about the hospitality of her family. Asu’s sister was there to meet us, standing outside looking for our taxi in the rain. So, as you can imagine the check in process had absolutely no problems for us and check out was equally smooth. Subsequently, when we felt slightly cold, her parents were immediately there with additional heaters, and after that there was no problem. Finally, we had left our coffee container at their place, and Asu made it possible for us to come back and collect it later.      Throughout the experience, Asu’s communication was excellent and almost instant. I also needed to reschedule travel plans just before the travel date because of unexpected changes at work, and that was done very smoothly.      I would also like to confirm that her home has all the amenities you need for a comfortable stay. Her home has a full kitchen and good facilities.      Finally, I would conclude by saying that Asu has a truly charming home. The hospitality demonstrated by Asu and her family make this a home away from home. A great location almost everything is 5 a 10 min walking distance. Great host was verry helpfull and friendly, because of him i could make the best of my week there and was able to make the most of my time there see a lot of places without wasting time on traveling or get stock in traffic,  verry thankfull and defently gonna return back here. From Day 1 until the end Hazar's communication was impeccable. He always tried to help or even fix minor issues in order to make my trip hassle-free. If you are looking for a place in the Asian side, there is hardly a better location than his place. Although the flat is located on one of the busiest street in Moda, you won't have any issues with noise during the night. Highly recommend. One of the finest views we’ve ever experienced in an Airbnb. We most certainly recommend it. Mina is a great host she was very helpfull and kind we loved her, everything that was written on the info of the house is true,  it was clean and nice, much love for her ❤️ Very clean and nice property. Highly recommended ... The apartment was very nice, well equipped and clean. I highly recommend for long stays. The stay went great and was very friendly. It was a pleasure staying at this hotel and we gladly recommend it. At first, we were a little bit apprehensive, because Elif provided us with an address that was different to the one shown in the ad.      We contacted Airbnb about this; but their Agents were USELESS (all we wanted to know was what the protocol was for such situations.) So in the end we decided to take the risk and go to the address provided by Elif.      Fortunately, it was the address for the flat described in the ad.      If you are flying into, from, or you are going to be in the vicinity of Sabina Gokcen Airport, this is a perfect flat, because it is located 5-10 minutes by car (taxi.)       However, if you are visiting Istanbul for the first time, and you are planning to do a lot of sightseeing, to visit all the main attractions, then please be advised that this flat is far away from the city centre (about 1 to 1.5 hours)      The flat is just as described in the ad, and all of the pictures are accurate. The flat in fact looks better than in the pictures. However, please note that the washing machine is located in the flat below (where Ali - the host - lives), and you'll need to negotiate with him (or Elif) a good time to do your laundry.      There are 2 medium size supermarkets, about 10 minutes walk from the flat, one of them is called 'Mopas', the other one is a new supermarket in the opposite direction, right in the corner of a new building. There are also many shops in that area including a bakery, a place that sells spitroasted chicken, a sweetshop, a fishmonger's, off-licences, and many kebab places.      The flat's owner and host is Ali (he lives in the flat below), and he is an extremely hospitable and friendly host. During our stay in the flat, he brought us something every day (Turkish delicacies.) Also when we did our laundry, he brought us our clothes ironed and folded.      We found Elif a very approachable and helpful person, always ready to help with information about the flat and its surroundings, and a very good liaison person with Ali (because unfortunately Ali doesn't speak English.)      So, if this is not your first time in Istanbul, and all you want to do is just relax and do nothing for a few days, this is a perfect flat, because you'll have everything you need within walking distance, and an extremely hospitable host (Ali) ready to accommodate you. This has been one of the best airbnb experiences I've had so far.   Duygu's place is extremely clean and comfortable. She has a very friendly cat as well who'll keep you company during your stay. And she is a great host. She was very helpful, responsive and sweet, and I would highly recommend everyone to stay here.    The area around her house is also very peaceful and quite and it's close to many nice coffee shops and restaurants.    I had a wonderful time. Everything about the place was amazing, location was near to the woods, the town center and shops, also the place was really clean and had neat details. Although, the price could be less than what it was.    I recommend this place to stay and enjoy the beautiful view from its balcony. Quite an ordinary hotel at an affordable price close to Taksim Square. Fiyat-kalite dengesi çok iyi. Manzara ve ambiyans nedeniyle evden çıkmak istemeyebilirsiniz. Barış bey sizin ve kendisinin aklına gelmeyecek her sorunda anında çözüm üretmeye çalışıyor. Temiz, sakin. Yürümeyi seviyorsanız toplu taşıma kullanmadan her istediğiniz yere gidebilirsiniz.       For foreign visitors the risk is you may not want to leave the house when you see the view. It's clean, tidy and suitable for families as well. Baris is so receptive to your questions. Highly recommended. cost-benefit 10/10 Great place to stay! great location and helpful host The apartment is really nice and cozy in a comparatively quite area of Istanbul close to the hustle and bustle of a metropolis. Great value for the money. Instant reposnse from the owner, great location. The flat is Ok, everything is quite good but at the same time old. The area is quite noisy and I didn't feel safe, even though it's in the city center. but perhaps that was because I travelled alone. Generally it was fine and Hikmet was a very nice host Cozy place to stay. It became for me the second home but just for one month unfortunately. I would like to come back again to Onur’s apartment. This place provides you all amenities and necessities. It was clean when I arrived and I tried to leave cleanness after me. You can use parking to get the Istmarina AVM. You can eat at home or outside in balcony or if you wish eat in Mado or another preferable restaurant/cafe. As for my host Onur is one of the best ones. He was super helpful, when I forget about him, he didn’t forget about me and was caring about my staying. Thank you so so much for you and your place Perfect stay in the heart of Istanbul. Nice apartment very quit and with nice decoration. The situation is excellent. The instructions to get there and to get the key were very clear. And Ferhat answer very quick to any questions. I recommend this place. The « what you get for what you paid » is excellent. I am an avid Airbnb lover. I would rather stay in a rustic neighborhood than a hotel any day. That being said, I would expect at least a greeting from someone when coming to a foreign country. The host and the greeter are not the same person, so I cannot say that Fernando is a bad host. What I can say is this:   Location is incredible if you really want to see the mosque.   If nightlife, good food and culture are what you want, stay on the Asian side near Galeta Tower.    No one greeted us. We had no direction, no water, leaks in the bathroom (which I reported), exposed wires in three rooms, a back door that had no key, a garden that was advertised but was not accessible (again, I asked), none of the windows opened, the place was old and unappealing and it did not feel like anyone cared.    I don’t need much, but a bottle of water in a city where the tap is undrinkable or a lesson on how to work the laundry machine which is written inTurkish, or the keys to ALL door so we could enjoy the entire space...that seems like a minimum. Disappointed and wish I would have stayed elsewhere. Thanks Demir for quick help with internet and clean apartment. Place is big and location is nice! Much better than expected. Thanks for hosting! Very nice place and host. Recommended Very nice place, well decorated and comfortable in an artsy neighborhood with an easy access to supermarkets, metro and the famous Istikal street. Some nights it can be a bit noisy outside but it's well bearable. The hosts are helpful and very communicative. I recommend this place! Horrible place to stay, this place smells terribly bad. I can’t imagine living in that gost house. we tried everything to take the odor out of building. all outlets were out , unsafe place to live in. the owner is greedy she tried to charge me for a day and cleaning fee for the place that is not in decent shape.      I had to cancle this place and Fazilet doesn’t know how to communicate with  her customers.      Save your time this place has no value of stay in.   STAY AWAY! great location, clean house, kind and generous people, plus great hospitality. I stayed here a full moth. Iman was extremely helpful and often texted to make certain that everything was right throughout my stay.  Sok market is lest than ten minutes walking and small markets are 1/2 a block.  Close enough to to the Taksim metro station ( about 15 minutes walking) that I could easily get all over the city.      Read his description. The kitchen and bathroom downstairs have very low ceilings. This was not a problem for me at all. Amazing host and amazing stay. Rarely is a place better than the photos, this is one of those places. Everything is nice, new and well equipped. The kitchen was fully stocked and the view is just stunning.       AMAZING hosts, Maurizio & Enise were so accommodating, responded quickly and went above & beyond with recommendations in the area.        Great location, short walk to cute cafes, restaurants and the famous Taksim Square.       The place is a perfect place to relax and enjoy the view.      We visit Istanbul often and can't wait to stay again.        Thank you, Maurizio & Enise for making our stay memorable! The location of the hotel it’s great however we didn’t get the room which is on the pictures. We got room with one more bed and different walls so the pictures aren’t accurate. When I went to reception agent called host and he said it should not be a problem since we are staying one night. The place was AMAZING!  Exactly like the pictures.  Everything in the unit was brand new and modern.  Most importantly, the Air conditioner worked!!!  I stayed in a few places in Turkey that advertised having AC but the AC did not fully work  I was happy that the AC here worked because it gets hot in Istanbul.  The apartment has a stove, microwave, oven and Iron, ironing board and a washing machine,  all the things that make for a comfortable stay.  The area is safe off a main road.  Its is about a 15 minute walk/8 minute drive to the main street in Taksim, so that was nice to be close enough to walk to get food to eat ect.  There are grocery stores on the way to taksim also.....you will have to walk up some hills, so be ready for that. :-)   Building was very secure with Security at the front desk at all times so I felt safe.  The pool and sauna in the building are also amazing!  The building itself is very new so everything is modern and beautiful.  The host communicated effectively with me from the very start and was readily available whenever I had an questions via (Hidden by Airbnb) .  They were even kind enough to let me check in early.  I absolutely loved and enjoyed my stay at this place and will definitely look to stay here whenever I am in Turkey.  You will not be disappointed! Kadıköy is a great neighborhood mixing youth, artistic and cool vibes with traditional and family apartments. It has all these nice cafés mixing with local shops. Huriye’s place is right in the center of it and carries that flare and vibes right into the apartment, in other words it makes it feel like you were still living the outside experience(artistic, social, young). We loved it! Not to mention that we had the apartment for ourselves, we were received with great friendliness and hospitality. We are glad to come back!!!!great place! Very recommended place to stay, near from anywhere!! Staying at Zehras flat was quite nice. It's located really good nearby the tower of galatar and you can even  see the bosporus from the terrace. The appartments are higly recommended. Very clean, tidy, were comfortable for 2 adults and 1 child and placed not far from metro and tram stations. The stay was amazing and the ppl there were very very helpful. Great location in authentic Istanbul district that close to the city centre. Clean and bright flat with shower set (shower gel, shampoo and conditioner).    Host helped us with our luggage and transfer to airports.       We really enjoyed to stay at Murat’s place. place it is nice, clean near everything. The guys in charge, very nice and helpful. I would stay again if I am back Perfectly welcomed by Parvin and his friend. The place is well located and has everything needed for an appropriate price. Great support in case you need anything, with smile and enthousiasm, thank you for your kindness, I wish you good fortune in the future ! ;) Fantastic, authentic Airbnb stay.  Feels like a “real” apartment.  Impeccable location with crazy beautiful rooftop view over Istanbul.  Excellent communication throughout.  I recommend it wholeheartedly! It is a great location. Close to everything. The host is very nice. The thoughtfulness, hospitality, location and view could not be better.  We were welcomed warmly and in a timely manner; communication with Burak and Gigi was quick and efficient.  We spend a month in the unit and wish it could have been longer.  The unit was clean, spacious and commanded one of the best views of the Bosporus in the area.  Working from the balcony with the Asian side of Istanbul as a backdrop was a nice conversation point during client calls.  Beds were comfy, bathroom was beautiful and kitchen was well stocked and functional.  Frequenting neighboring businesses - Caffe Privato, Barnathan Restaurant, the barber on the corner - is a must, as they are owned and staffed by warm, welcoming and gracious people. Very great and helpful hosts. Also very clean and great Location. Enjoyed the communication and the whole trip. their team was very responsible and respectful. there was a problem with the wifi and they fixed the problem very fast. very hospitable staff    problems : the room was in -2 floor and it was too small.  you do not have any mobile signal there too.    Totally it was a good place to stay at nights. The place is probably at the most perfect location in Istanbul. You can have panoramic view of Bosphorus and see the most prominent landmarks of the city not only from the spacious terrace but from all windows of the apartment as well. You can find your inner peace by watching the ferries pass by or gather around the outdoor fireplace with your friends and have the time of your life, your call! The apartment has all the amenities you could probably need with a sleek yet comfortable choice of furniture design. The neighborhood has some steep hills, however the apartment is positioned at fairly level location which makes it easier to go out and explore the vivid neighborhood. The host was reachable all the time and was really taking care of me during my check in, stay and check out. I’m definitely recommending the apartment to other guests! Great location and hospitality. We will definitely come back again if we visit the area in the future. Great place to stay, everything as described, fully recommended! The Room placed at the best part of Istanbul city! I hightly recommend you Fatih area to stay. Here is family area, a lot of nice bakeries, grocery shops, restaraunts, sweet houses, and its very close to Metro station and main bazaar.    Owner of hotel Vedat gave me better room (the biggest one) without extra payment)) thats so nice from him. Administrators was very kind and helpfull, gave me shampoo and cups for tea, extra towels. In room you will get: kettle, refrigerator, disposable slippers, towels, shampoo, soap, safe.    Room is really small, expecially bathroom, so dont have big expectations) but for me it was ok. There is no bad smell in room, there is clean sheets and towels, big windows. Maybe not much clean curtains and toilet, but its ok too. Not 5 stars hotel, so you dont expect much))  And maybe too much sounds at night from cars, cos road is right under your windows. But use earplugs, and no problem.       The area of hotel is very cool, nice, safe. And the price is very good for location like this. I recommend this private room. Five stars all over for Cuma whos is a generous and friendly host. The appartment is cosy and very clean. I truly appreciated. Very clean and tasty food near the hotel Güven was the best host ever, and he will be there if you need anything, I highly recommend to stay his apartments. Azade’s guest house is a must book if you plan to stay in Istanbul. The amenities alone make this guest house a great value but there is much more to love.       The proximity to everything in Kadikoy makes vacation life so simple. The decor is well thought out and makes the guest house a pleasant place to lounge.      Any time we had a question we were answered promptly.      To sum it up, if you can book this place, do it, you will fall in love. Amazing place. Lisya was an excellent host. I will stay here again the next time I’m in Istanbul. Clean, well located, aesthetic of the apartment fantastic and Kursad is always available.    The best play to stay if you plan on visiting Istanbul. I stayed at Zachary and Kubra’s place for just one night, but I wished I could have stayed longer. The apartment was super spacious and the rooftop terrace was just stunning. Taking the time to watch sunset and Sunrise over the Istanbul skyline was definitely worth it. Kubra was welcoming me with some Turkish coffee and was super open. She knows a lot about Istanbul and the history of it. I couldn’t order food at night because I didn’t have a Turkish SIM card but she just responded quickly and ordered it in her phone. I would highly recommend their place to anyone who travels to Istanbul and looks for a comfortable and beautiful place to stay. Muzo a nice, responsive person. Every thing was clean and as the picture.The location is good. Thank you for this beautiful hosting Okay so this place is located at an excellent location that should be top priority to every tourist. Secondly, the most important to me is in regards to the hygiene of the place and this was requirement was fulfilled. Lastly, the WiFi was okay except sometimes when their is a Heavy rainstorm the whole area blacks out for a hour, other then that this place is great to stay for a short trip. Furkan Mustafa is a great host who is almost always can be reached by AirBnB messenger or phone, also he wrote a really detailed instruction how to find the flat in a labyrinth of street near 4. (Dördüncü) Levent metro station.   Place itself is small, but has all enough even for a long stay (well-equipped kitchen, comfy bed, washing machine) and is 7...10 minutes on foot from the nearest metro station, also you can go from there to Sabiha Gökçen (SAW) airport by bus in 1 hour. The apartment is very spacious and confortable, it has living room with sofa, bedroom, small kintchen area, bathroom and terrace. Tv in living room and tv in bedroom. Bed is big and confortable. The room is very quiet, no noises coming from the street. There is air conditioner.      It's well located near many bars and restaurants. 10-15 minutes walking to Santa Sofia and other touristic atractions. Beside Santa Sofia you can take the tram to visit other places. This is very convenient.      Parvin, the owner is very friendly and interested about their guest. He provides info and can trips, excursions, airport transfer...      I recommend to use airport transfer on your arrival as Fatih district is made of narrow streets and alleys so it's a bit difficult to find if is your first time in the area.      To resume: good place to have some rest, friendly owner, good location to visit Istanbul. I thank the owner for the cozy apartment and warm welcome. everything was cool. Nice apartment right near the metro in a central location. Nearby cafes and restaurants. Getting in was very easy. I was met at the door and they took the time to show me around and how everything worked.       The views are amazing! Nice to sit by the window and have a cup of coffee in the morning.       There is a market just a two min walk away, where you can get all the food and toiletries you need. The subway is also just a short walk and gets you to basically anywhere in Istanbul.       A perfect spot for someone looking for a quiet place away from all the traffic  If you like authentic places just like us, I would recommend this flat to you because it definetely has a nice vibe as well as the apartment. It is also centerally located in Taksim. We really enjoyed our stay here and we are thankful for it. :) Mehmet is a very nice host. He helped us on private duties that had nothing to do with the apartment. The building is old but the apartment itself is well equiped and clean. The location is great; very close to Uskudar metro/marmary. I am happy to stay there again when I come back to Istanbul. Everything was perfect, those are serious people that will always help you and explain things very clearly. The flat is very clean, accurate and beautiful. The hostess was constantly in touch, helped with all questions. The place where the apartment is located is quiet and peaceful. Near shops, free Parking, the opportunity to go out and take a walk in the courtyard. I also want to note the stylish interior in which it is pleasant to be.      Unfortunately the exit to the terrace to the river is located at the back of the house and does not have a separate exit. It was not clear from the photo. The room and the apartment are just as pictured on the photos, everything is nice and cozy. I liked the location, and slept really well on the bed. The view is also nice and peaceful. And just generally everything felt like home to me, which was wonderful. We did not have a chance to get to know each other much with Tolga, but he was always friendly and helpful if I asked for something. Burak is very nice guy and his Appartment is clean and spacy located in good and safe area , easy to each everywhere . So comfy I extended my stay here. 100% would stay again! 5 stars the place is clean and nice. And the host is very nice. Great host, amazing view, nice apartment , enjoyed it very much! Mia’s home is wonderful! We were so lucky to find it. It’s as charming and elegant as it looks in photos and beautifully kept up. The communication is perfect and the area is a terrific base in Istanbul. We would return in a heartbeat. Very nice apartment. location is very central, clean and check in/out was very easy. Can recommend the apartment The place is very good. it's a 5 minute walk to Taksim square. Ali is a very good host and was always ready to help! He always responded in under 1 hour. everything was good and clean and the location is very close to the metro too. Great location, well taken care of, well supplied, recommend! Best Airbnb Experience! Beautiful modern studio on the 30th floor. Host is very kind and responsive. The studio is new and well furnished and has a great city view. The building Skyland is the tallest building in Istanbul with indoor, outdoor pool, gym, garage and 24 hrs security. Vadistanbul is a new modern district with a large shopping center, restaurants and grocery stores within walking distance.  You have access to metro and you can be in the tourist area in thirty minutes. Front desk arranged for a taxi to take us back to airport. Cosy room in big flat in the center of city. Nice building. Calm place . Near there are small restaurants. Nice treatment from Mr. Orabi. I would recommend staying in the apartment for its calmness, cleanliness, internet speed, and Mr. Orabi’s kind treatment Great clean and quiet place Great location, nice helpful owner, lovely cat. The place with the garden is very cozy and right behind the corner, there are some local shops. Just book it already! the best host ever, highly recommend!   房东人很好,推荐 We have felt at home. We had all the comfort that we needed, from the fireplace to the coffee machine. The garden was pretty, and the neighbours were very friendly.       Umit is a very thoughtful home owner, I recommend this place to anyone interested in the location. I've stayed for a few more days in the Red Room and again everything was perfect. Ilir was very flexible and helpful. I cannot recommend this host highly enough :) the house was clean, the location is very accessible to the majority of tourist places, iman is very good person he answers my question quickly and almost of the time he has a solution We had a very nice stay at GV suites. First because the apartment is well situated :    -  3 minutes walking distance from tramway and bus station which allow you to visit Eminönü, Fatih  as well as Besiktas and Ortakoy etc easily    - close to Karakoy boat station to reach the Asian part of Istanbul    - If you walk up the Hill you can also have a nice turkish  breakfast at Van Kahvalti Evi and reach Taksim square      Second, the apartment was clean and comfortable. Sofas can really be used as beds. Air conditioning works perfectly.       On top of that Gökhan was a perfect host, very nice, he carefully answered every question I had. Clean and hip place in an amazing location ATTENTION: if you or any of the people with you cant climb up steep streets them you definitely wanna look for something else guys !       + close to Istiklal street   + big enough for 5-6 people easily    + A/C available and working properly      - located in a questionable neighborhood   - you have to climb reeeally steep street to teach Istiklal street be careful!!!!   - shower is leaky and shower handle doesn't work (water coming out of hose instead)   - 1 roll of toilet paper!!? For 5 people for a week   - the guy doing check in cant speak any language other than Turkish and no communication is possible!!!   - to be honest you find much better accommodations with less price! I highly recommend this place. The apartment was sparkling clean and very stylish. Canan was very responsive. I will definitely stay there again. The host was a real superhost. polite and helpful. The appartement was just as described in the advertisement. Nice view, nice location. Thank you for everything. Yigit were so hospital and kind, if we return to Istanbul it will be the best place to stay in. I recommend it a lot ! My boyfriend  Booked the flat with 2 Other friends and everything was great. Timur is a great Host and helps you with everything!! The view is beautiful and its just 2minutes from taksim Square. You can find restaurants, Shops, markets very close to the flat. nice place and good location Amazing view,    perfect location,    very nice flat.    friendly hosts .   Thank you for this airbnb experience. I stayed a month as a solo 25 year old female and was really happy with everything. Burak was super communicative and made me feel very comfortable, also provided me a Istanbulkart card which is used to get on metros, buses, etc.       Do remember that Istanbul is hilly, something I totally forgot, the apartment is close to Taksim but there is a quite a hill you have to climb to get to the center. The metro is close by which is helpful, as well as grocery stores.      Solid value for the price I received. Even though I could only stay one night, because of an unexpected change in my plans, I very much enjoyed my stay at Nazan's place. She is very nice and the apartment is clean and very centrally located right in the heart of the best district of Istanbul. I fully recommend it. Uğur's place was great and very central to all the attractions and shops of Moda. The airconditioning was fantastic for the summer heat. This is a great place for one person or a couple. I would definitely recommend this place. I am really like this apartemen and next month when i come to İstanbul again i will stay here again … the owner very helpful and fast respon … nearby if Wanna go to taxim area and Nisantasi by walk …  the owner is very friendly and handsome I love this location and house This has been an amazing trip. The AirBnb was really perfect, especially the kitchen, it had everything you need and it also looks very nice. The apartment was very clean and had enough space. Location couldnt have been better.    I can really recommend staying at Nails Apartment. you'll never regret staying here! the location is brilliant, Kadikoy and Moda especially is one of the coolest neighborhoods in Istanbul. the apartment is adorable, very clean and hospitable, the interior design is brilliant, you can feel the artistic touch of Emre through it. Handed and Emre are very interesting and fun to know and stay with. we only stayed there for 4 days, I highly advise you to book with them for longer. 4 days for us went by so fast!    thank you Handed and Emre! Wonderful hotel. Great terrace. Great breakfast. Friendly staff It is a nice place right at the heart of Besiktas, surrounded by restaurants and shops. It is suitable for up to 4 persons.    The only point is that it does not have an elevator, if you have heavy and large or you have problem with stairs I don't recommend it to you, Other than that everything was fine. Nice apartment after arriving for one night to sleep well.      The apartment is being rented. The host constantly mentions telling neighbors that we are her friends. Since house owner lives on the floor above. Was nice like always! Very nice and clean apartment on the 2nd floor. There is an elevator which is great. I stayed for 1 month and I’m very pleased with my stay. Only 10 minutes away from Huzurevi metro station by walking. Great bonuses are the fast Wifi and the big TV which has Netflix. I highly recommend staying here. This was a lovely  Airbnb in a great location. Selim was so helpful from the start and was always a quick message away. We really appreciated everything he did for us including helping organise transport for our 2 big bike boxes. A highly recommendable place to stay. Thanks Selim! The apartment is well located. Its main advantage is the sunny terrace where you can watch the sunset. However, we unfortunately had a few issues during our stay (no hot water, no shower gel, kitchenware and other things unclean, ...). I'm not sure the wifi would be powerful enough for remote working/digital nomad, but there is a great place to work 10m away from the apartment. Excellent accommodation with a large number of beds. Perfect location: 3 minutes to Istiklal. Despite  the fact that the apartment is located on the ground floor, it was quiet and cozy. Also, there is terrace outside. Of the minuses: had to buy few kitchen things. And also, the bathroom is not designed very well: it is very small, the shower is located together with the toilet in the same room, and there are no glass door or recesses. So after the shower the bathroom/toilet are totally in the water. Cüneyt’s place is perfectly located, very pleasant and comfortable, equipped with anything you might need during the stay. Communication was easy and friendly. Recommended Very comfy and cosy apartment in a good location and a very very helpful host. I would book it again if I'll need. All as on the photos and even better, has everything needed to come and live. Good internet suitable for online work. We had a great time! Perfect location so close to beautiful shops, cafes, restaurants. The apartment is very big (right now with one beautiful and big bedroom) with lovely furniture and details! The hosts are very nice and helpful and responded the next second to any questions we had! Thanks a lot! Mehmet is a great host, and this is a fantastic apartment in the best part of İstanbul (in our opinion!). We loved the spacious living room with a good desk for working from home, good size bedrooms, two balconies, lots of light, and close to all amenities. Host was always available and very considerate. Very comfortable apartment in the new and clean building. Wonderful view of the Bosporus. Nice streets with cafes in 10-minute walking distance. The apartment is good and cozy. Location is beautiful. We loved our stay at Zalals place, we stayed for 9 days and she was always a text away.   the appartment had everything we needed and more.   Osman helped us alot with a lovely smile.   the appartment was very clean, cozy and felt like a home  the location is great and the neighbourhood is great too, many shops/supermarkets a few steps away. Dear Alexandre, thank you very much for hospitality!       The flat is comfortable, safety, location for business is perfect. You can find everything you need to go downstairs ( food, ATM, metro, takxi, ) The beach( by taxi )close too .   No problem with a schedule ( check in and check out) .   I will recomend to my friends and collegues this place for Istanbul ☝️ Good location near kadirga park, must stay The attention was incredible Nice studio in a very good location - 5 mins to Galata tower, 15 mins walk to Dolmabahce and Galata bridge. There are many cafes around to eat out.    The place is compact yet everything u need is there. There was a small problem with the bed mattress that was fixed same day by the owner.    The stairs are a bit steep and narrow - please take into account for luggage bringing up as there is no elevator.    Communication was very smooth and fast, the owner helped with local tips.    Great value for money Everything in the apartment was exactly as shown in the pictures. The kitchen is perfect for making small meals, and the inclusion of a dishwasher was a life saver. The balcony is also a welcome plus.The AC is small but can effectively cool the entire apartment which was the case even when I stayed there during the heat wave. The location though is the real plus point of this place. It is located in lively Moda and is perfect place for those who want to experience the Istanbul nightlife. That said, the way the apartment is situated towards the back portion of the building (i.e. away from the street) means that outside noise doesn't make it in. Moda is also a short walk away to the ferries that will easily connect you to the rest of the city.       And Umut was incredibly helpful and always on hand when I needed him, which definitely made my stay more comfortable. I definitely recommend this place! Clean flat with great view to Istanbul. Location is not for everyone, for sure, homeless people sleeping near the entrance, persistent urine odor at the street, and so on. However the flat is good and Emire is a great host, and i can recommend it, if you ok with the location. Staying at Seda's place was wonderful! Her apartment is even cuter than in the pictures and felt really homely and comfortable. There is everything you need in the apartment, and the location is great - really lovely little cafes, restaurants, antique and vintage shops just a stone's throw away or you can go up to Taksim Square. Seda's friend was there for the check-in, communicating with Seda was really easy and she made a lovely and helpful list of recommendations of things to do in the area. Do not hesitate to stay in this lovely apartment. Thanks for everything! Our stay at bariş place was great, the host was super friendly and helpful. The house was extremely clean when we arrived and we enjoyed the Bosphorus view. Our only problem was that there is no elevator and i was traveling with my parents who are a bit old. And we couldn’t find a place to park (This is because istanbul is a very densely populated). But other than that everything about this place is amazing. Great host. Flat is in a good location. Its a short walk to shops and restaurants. It wasnt as clean as pictured and had a strong smell of smoke. The hot water heater wasnt on and needed some tuning in order to not error out. This was resolved after contacting the host and getting some instructions on what to do. The communication was excellent, however, it was just not what I was expecting. Ibra's place is fantastic, he is a super host, so helpful and friendly. I stayed there twice and that was a very good decision. Kadikoy is a quite interesting district, full of cafes and cultural spots, Moda is also an extremely cool experience.    Location is really convenient : there is ferry to the European side, tram, shuttle bus to Istanbul airport, metro station and the Marmaray it’s just one station ahead. Highly recommended. A great host, ready to support with anything you might need. Very helpful and easy to communicate with. We enjoyed our stay in Istanbul. Great space We booked this place for a week, but checked out after 2 days.    The airbnb is located next to main attractions near Galata but hard to find for taxi drivers. The room is small but enough for a short trip. The breakfast was in a lunch box. We put a \"please make our room\" sign on the door but it hasnt been cleaned for 2 days nor did we get a towel change. When we asked the recepionist she told us that they have 2 hotels and no capacity right now, but she could give us fresh towels. We payed for this service but  couldnt get any help. We called Mr Hakan but he didnt get on the phone, so we booked another hotel. The apartment is so lovely, light and airy with lots of thoughtful touches which made our stay so much easier (I.e. providing a large bottle of water, coffee, tea, washing powder, etc). The location is fantastic, there are loads of great places to eat nearby (including some excellent bakeries!) and there is a really fun vibe about the place. Also a very reasonable walking distance to ferries (for exploring along the Bosporus) and the old town. Taskin met us to let us in and was really welcoming and gave some useful recommendations. Absolutely will recommend this to friends and family! We fell in love with the view from the window. It's great in any time of the day!   There is a lot of space in the flat - guests can go about their business and not interfere with each other. Very actual for business trips This is a cute, functional place for a couple that wants to be centrally located but eat almost all of their meals out. The kitchen/self-catering facility is basic, at best, and not really conducive to cooking for yourself. I think it's overpriced for what it is, but the space is cozy enough and the host helpful, so maybe you can justify the price based on it's location and the nearby restaurants and public transit options. Sev, thank you very much!   I really liked your place.   And you were so friendly, kind and welcoming!)   You helped me last night and that was very nice of you. I will never forget it)      I highly recommend this place.   The room is small but very bright. It is very calm and good rest there.   At the same time, this place is in the middle of the coolest Moda district, full of vintage shops, cafes and bars, and not far from the sea and ferry station.      *It's worth knowing that there are 2 rooms for rent, and that during quarantine the hostess asks not to use the kitchen if possible. Apartment in good condition, two floors with 3 bedrooms - super! The location is great, next to the main pedestrian street, many restaurants and shops! Location is nice, the neighbors around are friendly. Neighbors treat me very well. Landlord is also quick to solve the problem. I think the details can be better, for example,   1) Prepare some garbage bags, conversion plugs, and wiring plugs in the room. There is no socket at the head of the bed. Charging can only use in the living room, which is inconvenient.   2) There is no air conditioning in the living room, the landlord can prepare a fan to be better.   3) The kitchen does not have a fruit tray for storing fruits, so it is not convenient to clean the fruits.   4) It is now during CONVID-19, it would be better to prepare some disinfectant alcohol in the room.   5) I have lived for a long time. I suggest the landlord can prepare more thin summer quilts in the room's closet, so that guests can choose the quilt that suits them according to their own heating level. Nice place! Ela is a very responsive host, thanks to her everything went quite smoothly. With nice hospitality of Özlem, it is such a sweet place that impossible to find anywhere else^^ Great place, so convenient and love the decor !    I’ll def stay there again if I come back to Istanbul :) Thank you very much for every thing    The staff were friendly specially GEORGE  he is a wonderful guy very helpful and  so thank you George       The room was very clean and well decorated    Location very nice and just behind istiklal street (taksim)    Over all  i highly recommend this property Overall the apartment does its job and it is very good value for money (Website hidden by Airbnb) The location was in the center and everything around  the apartment. Ertan was very nice and answered quickly. Easy check-in and check-out.      Only the sound in the evening. It can be heard on the weekends because there is cafes in the street.   But , I'd like to stay and I'll come again. What a perfect location in the heart of the action in Istanbul! If you are looking to immerse yourself and all the beauty, sites, flavors, adventures, community, and wonders that Istanbul has to offer then this is the perfect place to stay! The moment you walk out the door you become part of this wonderful city, make friends with locals, and feel like you are a part of it all. Our host was very responsive and helpful and the accommodations were wonderful. Nice place, near all important and touristic places. Great apartment in excellent touristic location in old city near many sites such as the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia. We rented both units at the same time which was perfect for our family of six but with two bedrooms with 3 beds each it could accommodate far more (up to 10). This also gives you two kitchens, two bathrooms and two washing machines. The neighborhood is quaint and old and the neighbors are friendly.  In my opinion it would be ideal for 2 to 3 nights. after that the hassle of getting through the crowds to see other parts of Istanbul gets a bit much. there's so much to see in this city of 20+ million people outside Sultanahmet area that other areas would allow for quicker travel to other parts of the city. That said, Selim is a great host and helped us with a few things including airport transfer, printing covid test results, and more. he's a really nice guy. Highly recommend! We stayed in two of the apartments here.  We were very pleased.  The highlights are comfort, cleanliness, great location (with 5-6 minute walks), and an attentive landlord.  Cleaning service was also very good. Thank you keji for hosting us, the place is beautiful just as it shows in pictures even better, keji was very helpful provided us with all our needs.   I totally recommend him. Osman is a great host! He is happy if the guests are happy. Always there if you have any questions or requests.       The flat is astonishing. Very stylish and cozy with a great view of the city and Bosphorus. In the kitchen, you find everything you may need. At night, it is so peaceful to sleep and the bed is comfortable. I didn’t wanna leave this place but gonna come again for sure when I visit Istanbul.       The location is super cool to hang out with nice cafes, bars and restaurants. Close to the main sightseeings and short walk to many famous neighborhoods .    Highly recommended! welcoming host clean space calm house I am sure you are looking for a review before you rent, just do it! very nice place and very clean. The host, Mehmet, was awesome.    Location is amazing and Balat is a great place to visit in Istanbul.    one small down side is the place does not get direct light from Sun but we spent the whole day outside then it was not a problem.    I will definitely book again this place if I want to visit Istanbul. The apartment was really nice, clear, light colored, but we had problems with hot water because the heater didn’t work. I talked to the owner, he promised to solve this problem Good authentic apartment in Fatih area,  with easy access to all parts of the city,  lot's of shops and cafes in the locality,  nice terrace,  helpfull host,  would stay there again Hotel location is perfect room is clean AC working very well bathroom is very big neat and clean.cleaner daily clean well ur room and the hotel located in safe area near to allot of restaurants , mosque  but specially Mr.Aziz the receptionist he is very help full always ready to help you my stay was only for two nights but i stay almost 7 nights. Highly recommended.  Really nice and cozy place to stay! It's a good location and easy to get to many places in Istanbul. Erol and Emre were nice and helpful. Would stay again. We stayed one night though liked the place very much. Really nice apartment,clean,has everything you need and it is  in a really safe and pretty neighborhood. I traveled from Florida to see my parents after six years. She didn't let us in because she said we had lots of luggage. I couldn't even believe that! This place is terrible—lousy location. Lucin attached us in front of people and assaulted us for having a lot of luggage! She didn't let us go upstairs, and we were trapped in the middle of the valley for ours! She called us liars and assaulted us and teamed up against us with some men she has in the restaurant that the room is located! This place is fraudulent and highly unprofessional. I reported it to Airbnb and will follow up to keep this place away from trapping people. Of course I recommend staying here again to meet Ciwan and his brother, and learn more about Istanbul. The location is very good, it's 4 min walking from Taksim Square. The only comment I can say is relating to the neighborhood, it's a little noisy for the one who will work while staying there. Overall it was a wonderful place! Duygu was an excellent host and was very responsive though text messaging.  I also appreciated her Trust in allowing  us to self check out without waiting for someone to come and inspect the unit :)  Thank you for that and it was a great time saver. Response time was poor as I would have had to stay on the street all night.      The host wasn't there, and at the last minute she called out to a friend of hers who had no idea what I was going to do, but did everything he could to help.   I booked the room for two months, but I stayed for one night, forced because it was late and I was very tired, I left for a hotel for one week and I will go home without staying as I planned for two months in Istanbul.      The room is not clean and the table has hair on it and a lot of dust.   The bed is not suitable for sleeping.   Just an old mattress with no cover, no pillow.      It was not made clear that the road to the apartment is very steep, and it is generally difficult to reach unless people are accustomed to living in the area. Absolutely amazing stay. Great value for money! It’s so nice to travel and to stay at places like Mehmet’s, he was very helpful and friendly, he gave me good recommendations on how to get to places, the places was beautiful and very clean Simple but very good room for a very good price. Location is perfect, and so is the breakfast! Thank you! I highly recommend this apartment. It is very spacious, central and modern looking. The place is very close to the Taksim square, where you can eat, shop or access public transport to reach other parts of the city. Aziz himself is very easy to reach and helped us greatly in check-in and check out. The apartment is also very clean. I would come back for my next trip. The room is clean and comfortable, besides its not so far from the famous historical places. Ali is very nice host, he will offer you everything for your comfortable stay. It was my pleasure to stay here.    However, I am 20 years old, I am from Czech republic and I started to travel the world - every month, different country. And Turkey was my first stop. I am greatful for that Betül made an exception and took me as a male. She told me that she wanted to support me. Also she showed me shops, helped me around and answered every my question. I am glad that I stayed with Betül for a month and I can only recommend her. The apartment is very spacious and clean and the bed was very comfortable. The receptionist were very nice and helpful. The location has everything with a supermarket, pharmacy and starbucks right at your doorstep. We very much enjoyed our stay and will definitely come back again. Thank you! The apartment was extremely beautiful with an amazing roof top.  Great central location as well.  Ugur was an amazing host, very responsive and quick to help with anything.  I highly recommend this loft. We had such a lovely stay! We immediately felt right at home. The location was perfect. There were so many yummy places to eat. I suggest going to Hungry! You won’t regret staying here and I can’t wait to stay again.  3 The apartment is truly historic with amazingly high ceilings and authentic floors. The view from the balcony is nice.    Good option for 1-2 nights, especially if you spend most of your day outdoors as the natural light and fresh air is very limited due to the location of the room whithin the apartment. The room was perfect for my stay. It’s located close to Sultan Ahmet (Blue Mosque) and plenty of restaurants. Saban had the room cleaned periodically and was very responsive :) 10/10 would recommend staying here Ebru is an amazing host, very reliable, friendly and attentive. The place is as described …it has a warm feeling, very clean and provides the comfort of a beautiful family home while being walking distance to Acibadem hospital, metro station and Capitol shopping mall. I would definitely stay again. Location is great with 2 supermarkets below the flat ,    The bad thing is only 1 air conditioning in the whole flat located in the sitting room and the rest of the house is a sauna in the heat .   Host is very nice and he always want to help . Hope the air conditioning issue would be fixed . I would stay there again if this issue is fixed Quite neighbourhood,   Lots of shops and restaurants, 5mins from main bars, 10 mins max from everywhere is everything you need.   You will be happy with the room and surroundings. Great stay! Nice view, great location and the host had excellent communication. I would definitely stay here again! That was really amazing stay. The house is clean and big and just like the picture and has everything. It’s quiet too. We had a great stay at Sinan with my sister . It’s good value for money, great location literally next to everything. Sinan is a nice guy who is reachable all the time. He has helped us so much with providing us with informations we needed.   I highly recommend staying at his place especially when in budget Cengiz was a best host I’ve ever seen on Airbnb. He was so helpful with whatever we needed. We spent Ramadan there and he got us some supplies that we needed and he got it for us(Very Nice guy) day . The place was clean nice space close to everything Highly recommended The apartment is super close to the main attractions (Haggia Sofia, Blue Mosque, etc.). Lots of great restaurants & shops nearby, too! Saban was super responsive, so I really appreciate that. Overall, a great place to stay & awesome host! Thanks for the services. We will come there again anytime we visit Istanbul An amazing host, location and apartment. I couldn’t ask for more! I’d recommend anybody stay here, enjoy the freshly squeezed juice below, coffee shop opposite and the incredible luxury of this apartment. I enjoyed my stay. Location is amazing, the checkin/checkout was seamless, the place was very small, but very clean. it is a good place the neihhborhood is getting better near everything thanks Bahram I've been visiting Istanbul at least once per year for the past decade, and Tamer's place is my favourite of all the various hotels, Airbnbs and friend's apartments I've stayed in.      The views from the rooftop are incredible (even more impressive than they look in the photos), and the location is perfect, as it's a short walk from Taksim, an even shorter walk down to the trams and ferries in Karaköy, and just around the corner from the Şişhane metro station. Plus when it comes to restaurants, cafés, bars, art galleries, shopping, colourful street life, etc, the Beyoğlu district is the best place to be in the city.      The apartment itself is in a beautiful historical building with super high ceilings, wooden floors and loads of character. And Tamer is a great host and cool guy, who makes sure to take care of all the small details so guests really feel at home. I'd definitely stay here again on my next trip, and hopefully for a longer period of time. Faruk's apartments are exactly as described (and seen in the pictures), and also spotlessly clean. His communication is instantaneous no matter the time of day, and nothing is too much trouble for him and his team. You certainly can't ask for a more central location, and even though its not cheap, you definitely do get value for money here and we'd highly recommend booking this for your next stay in Istanbul! Great apartment. All amenities. There is air conditioning, iron, washing machine.  Hot and cold water. Convenient area. Very close to the metro. The owner is always in touch. We really liked it. We'll come here again. The room is much smaller than the pictures however it was a nice stay. The location is not the best but as we did not need to travel too much it wasnt a problem. Really enjoyed the stay at Damla’s apartment. The location is excellent, a quiet area, just a few steps away from a nice neighborhood market and mall as well as marmaray train connection. The apartment is in an impecable shape and Damla a very helful host that explained well all the ins and outs. Nothing to complain about - will definetly stay again next time i visit. If you are looking for a cozy room near everything, look no further. Ilir is a great host and the flat is amazing. Thanks for everything! Very good location! Rooms was clean and comfortables. The host are very nice and willing to help you with anything yo need. The apartment is close to the important landmarks of Istanbul. Mustafa is a nice and helpful guy. He helped us with everything we asked like doing a PCR test at our place. The apartment is not well equipped for a long stay: there where no washing machine, cleaning or cooking utensils. Just enough sleep. Although Mustafa responded to our request to make up for the deficiencies as much as possible.   Thank you, Mustafa. An outdated apartment with steep stairs which are not ideal for guests which bring heavy/big suitcases. Unfortunately the WiFi didn’t work. The bed is really hard and you kan feel the iron springs in the mattress when you lay on it which isn’t very comfortable. The location is perfect; it’s near different must-sees of Istanbul (walking distance) and/or near the metro. The quality for the price you pay is more or less okay.. The apartment is really tiny, but it is very well organized and has everything you need. It is also located close to Taksim Square, where you have access to restaurants and the subway to go to a lot of places. Because the apartment is not located on a busy street, it quiet at night. So, you can sleep well. Even better than the apartment is the host, Deniz. He is gracious, accommodating, and very hospitable and is only a click away any time you have a question or a request. I really appreciated his customer-oriented attitude and sincerely thank him for it. He is definitely someone I would love to have again as a host. I recommend this hotel 100%%%. It’s terrible place dangerous area neighbors never sleep a lot of noise no airco bad internet . I don’t conseil anybody to stay in kasimpasa specially the area of this appartement cause of this place I hate to go to turkey again Great; great location and host ;)   Amazing stay The place was really nice and in a very convenient location. The hosts were amazing, helpful and very accommodating. We ran into them at the tower pub nearby, shared some drinks and fun times with them as well! I highly recommend this location if you want to have fun in Istanbul. Clean apartment, perfect location, everything worked, would definitely stay here again on my next trip... This Airbnb was in the best location! Hosts were great, house was beautiful, and we had such a great time. It is also very family friendly as we had a small child with us. 10/10! The location is great, i’ve spent a long time in Istanbul and this is my favourite district: many cosy shops, vintage shops, coffee bars. You may find different food if you are tired of eating only Turkish food. The apartment are not expensive but the landlord made it authentic and cosy. People here write that it is not ideal, but it is ok with this price. If you travel aloune or you re a couple of people-there is enough pace inside. The photos are real Taksim Terrace Hotel na Airbnb? Very good location, near of Galata tower an Galata bridge, metrostation and tram, Tunel tram. A cosy small rooms with shower and bed. A good Wifi and elevator to 6th floor. A great view to Bosfor and bridges to old part of Istanbul on Terrace on 6 level. The hotel offer a breakfast on terrace for a good price too. A good receptionist service (Merdan)English, Turkish, Russian and help with PCR Covid test. Thank you very much!  I had a wonderful experience, This is a perfect Apartment and Location!! Neat and Cozy, Omar (Host) was very supportive he guided alot,many thanks, i really recommend this stay. The Unit was ok and clean. The hosts were very nice. Its Location was well and easy to access everywhere. The building does not have elevator,so it was our difficult to go up and down stairs. There was a lot of noise around home, for I live in a quiet neighbourhood, noisy place bothers me. Keiran's appartment is very well located, few minutes walking to Galata Tower, Galata bridge or Karaköy. Taksim is half an hour walking distance which is very helpful for airport's shuttle. The neighborhood is nice with coffees, restaurants and shops. Keiran is very reactive. Very easy and autonomous Check in and checkout. The rooftop is very nice with an amazing view on the bosphore. We were 3 and the apartment was big enough and well equipped. The bathroom was clean with a really good shower. The only bad point : the sound isolation, there was some work construction in the street which wake up us each morning at 8am. We spend a really plaisant stay in Keiran's appartment. The place is cozy and comfy to stay. Thanks for the owner for the providing a good service. Cengiz's place was amazing and super easy to find! Very central close to public transport to get across to the European side etc. Parking is also available if you have your own vehicle! We loved the stylish interior decor and amazing cleanliness of the place and Cengiz had amazing local tips for not only Istanbul but for all of Turkey as a whole. He is an amazing host and great tour guide! Will definitely stay again when back in town!      Thanks so much guys! Nice place and kind host Andreia & her flatmate Dilşah are just lovely and their home is located at a nice neighborhood, it's clean and comfortable.   I had an amazing time with them, totally recommend  We are a group of 8 friends and our experience was so great in this apartment. First of all, the location is simply PERFECT. The views of Galata Tower from the terrace are amazing. Everything is well connected from there. The apartment is big and comfortable, divided in two different houses one next to the other. It has everything you can need and it was very clean. Highlight the huge predisposition of Eyup, who was all the time aware of us, even he came with us to show us the neighborhood and other restaurants and landmarks. We will come again, for sure! Lovely apartment in the very center, a couple of minutes to Taksim and metro, very convenient. Perhaps families with children will be uncomfortable: the stairs are very steep, but I was fine. Clean, comfortable, spacious, great view! Cute place and the location is excellent. Ideal to have everything within walking distance Mahir is a kind, nice host. He makes sure the house is ready and clean. It’s a great place with an excellent location. STOP LOOKING! This one is it. It has everything you're looking for. How do I know? Because I was you a few months ago. Scrolling through… looking, looking, comparing trying to find the perfect place. Istanbul is such a huge city that you have to get the perfect location. Burak's place is so centrally located to all the major attractions. Literally steps from the Galata Tower, minutes from the Galata Bridge, 4-5 minute cab ride (3-4$ US) from the Grand Bazaar, 10 min walk to the spice bazaar, short tram ride to the Blue Mosque... you get the point. Located on a quiet ... very charming street with restaurants and cafes steps away. The interior is well equipped with everything you need for short or longer stays. Washer in the flat worked perfect. Wifi speeds were fast enough for streaming and any work you need to do. My daughter completed schoolwork as my son played video games. Comfortable beds with clean rooms. A/C in every room but you won't need it with the perfect breeze. Comfortably accomidated myself, wife and two teenage children.  Burak was not intrusive but always available to answer any question. Thank you for a wonderful stay!!! We will be back soon! don't waste your money   terrible The apartment was as described. The location is perfect with its close proximity to all the great landmarks and shopping streets. Übeydhullah is the most caring host we had so far and he made our stay an amazing experience. The apartment is well equipped and clean. The neighbourhood is quite at night and the view from the windows is just perfect. You can’t find a better host. He was helping me with a credit card problem, or simply charging my phone. There was never a question or a problem that wasn’t solved. At the end it wasn’t only my host, it was like friendship. I hope that we meet again in future. The place really felt like home. They’ve thought through all the details from blackout blinds to including toothbrushes. The view is amazing. The host is very reasonable and accommodating and speaks perfect English Nice and central places This place so amazing , all the stuff so helpfull . And very near to everywhere . Aslıhan is very warm and welcoming!! I had a very comfortable stay at Aslıhan's. The room  is in the centre of the city and really close to metro station which is a huge plus point for tourists! Definitely recommended if you're looking for a place to crash during your vacation Just perfect, i highly recommend it This is one of best Airbnb accommodations I have stayed in Istanbul , clean and in a great location . You can also enjoy the quiet place to rest when you back home . The host is very helpful, you can ask him anything whenever you need help during your stay in Istanbul. Highly recommend! Had amazing experience during my stay, thanks to Mr Coşkun. This can be the best airbnb in Istanbul. You will have an unobstructed views of beautiful Bosphorus from private sun deck & terrace. Apartment is located in Cihangir surrounded with boutique restaurants. You will be in walking distance to Taksim area and short commute to famous parts of the city such as Besiktas, Bebek, Galata tower and historical Peninsula. Incredible apartments in the historical center of Istanbul. Very nice, but due to the central location it was noisy even at night, so be prepared for that. Farouq is very hospitable. He is ready to help in any non-standard situation, always in touch. I highly recommend him, it is a great luck to meet such a host. Highly recommend staying here. It was the best experience! Apartment was too beautiful that made me change my imagination about a future retirement home!! :) The flat is spacious more than I expected. The view is amazing. The flat is clean and comfy. The amenities are full and usable. The description are accurate!!      However, better using uber or taxi for your first coming to Nebi’s flat!! This place was amazing!! Perfect location, great communication and wonderful terrace, great view of beautiful Istanbul! Burcu's place and her hospitality were wonderful.  I cannot recommend the place enough.  The apartment is clean, beautifully furnished, and has tall windows throughout which make the view of the sea even more spectacular.  We spent most of the time hanging out on the comfortable balcony watching boats pass by.  The location is slightly removed from the bustle of the center.  At the same time it is only a 5 minute walk to get to the markets, restaurants, and shops.  Burcu was very kind and helpful-- she gave us some good tips and was easy to communicate with.  I hope to visit again :) The apartment is equipped with lovely details and a great place to have a relaxed and cosy stay in Galata - Istanbul!    Highly recommend! The room was perfect for short stay in Istanbul, we loved it and definitely will return. Apartment is as the pictures. The host is willing to assist at any time and was very accommodating. Highly recommended  Had great time staying at Eren place. Flat was sparkling clean with all essentials in order. Enjoyed my stay so much that I extended my stay twice. Eren and Gizem were also very helpful from the beginning, available at all times whenever I had any questions. Definitely I recommend Eren place if you are planning a trip to Istanbul. Everything was perfect! Highly recommended.  A cozy and budget-friendly room in a convenient location. If you are looking to explore the city and mostly need a place to take a quick shower and rest your head after a day of sightseeing (Istanbul's most important sights all within a stone's throw!), this place can work quite well for you. This host is worth visiting. The apartment is very well decorated with it's authentic rustic Turkish style. The area is cozy and people in the neighbourhood were very helpful and open hearted. The bed is great. There is a washing machine. A good view from the windows both in the front of the apartment and from the bathroom. Finding food and everything you need is just around the corner. Housekeeping was very kind and also the wife of the host. Very helpful people always ready to help you if you need guidance for the local area or anything else. Many things to see in the neighborhood. The kitchen is good with a gas stove. What you get for your money here is worth every dime. Entrance is comfortable. Parking opportunities are not always good. We had to pay to a local to have our car parked. Majdalden is very responsible person help it me from the arrive util the leaving. Everything was perfect as described and extra more. Clean beds and all the kitchen equipment was clean.    Thank you very much I saved your house for next trip  Gunes hanim was really helpful. The house was super clean and roomy. The location and neighborhood were excellent too. Absolutely Fabulous. 6 Stars!    Everything was completely professional. The flat is huge and immaculately cleaned. I was delighted to tip the cleaner.    The view is wonderful. Granted, half the window is taken up by the mosque nextdoor. But by sitting on the sofa looking out, a few people could enjoy brilliant views of Bosporus, Topkapì, Aya Sofia, and Blue Mosque. All day and night.    Hot water went out sometimes, simply needed to be reset from the heater in kitchen.   Communication was always immediate and helpful. Recycling is downstairs, across from Greecology (great espresso) btw this location is great, perfect neighborhood you access every thing  you need, close to Taksim and Isteglal, by the way Serdar is a great host. me and my family stayed there for a month.   I hope if you go there enjoy your vacation It’s really a wonderful place and it was beyond my expectation. This is my second time I stayed here and if I ll visit Istanbul again, I ll choose this place. It’s very clean with some adorable pets and it is located in the heart of the old city, every thing is near to you, Aya Sofia, blue  mosque, Topkapi palace and the tram station (3 mins walk) that makes travel around Istanbul very easy. Mekan is a friendly guys who speaks a lot of languages and good communicator. He is an instant responsive and trying to make his/her guest confortable all the time. I felt home when I stayed in Maken’s place and I definitely recommend it to every one coming to Istanbul. Everything as on the photos, but I had to ask to provide chair and sleepers. But guys provided it very quickly.    The room is quite small, but it not so old as another ones in this district of Istanbul.   I would recommend this place for its price Amazing location, worthy the money, every penny. The apartment is extremely cool, like living in the middle of your friendly neighborhood! Everything is a few steps of this great jewel. Furkan is very sincere, helpful and committed to make you feel welcome. If you can afford it... don’t hesitate... totally worthy! A superb experience and alternative to a traditional hotel stays.  Getting a taxi to take you to the exact address can be a challenge. Just tell them to take you to the Galata tower and hike the rest of the couple of blocks. I spent a month in Asu's apartment and it was perfect. It is conveniently located yet isolated and quiet when you get home from a day out in the very busy city. Both the subway station and a large ferry terminal are short walks away as is the bus to and from the airport, which is a bonus because it is really inexpensive and very easy to use.    The apartment is great. It is clean and organized with all the things needed for a long stay. More importantly though is that it is simply a very comfortable space that I was always glad to return to. There is a very good bed and I never had any issues sleeping. A very clean newer bathroom too, with great lighting. And, the balcony, with it's green space and kitties is perfect to unwind on after a day out. Fantastic!    Asu and her family are great hosts as well. Always very kind and thoughtful.    I'm thrilled that I stayed here. Was great pleasure to stay here Windows was very old and so much voice coming between it! This is my second time to stay at Mehmet place. With no doubt this  apartment is the best place to stay in when visiting Istanbul especially for month or more. Everything you need is just less than two minutes walk distance from the apartment. In addition there are two big malls with 5 minutes walk distance!       As usual, Mehmet was super nice and helpful and would reply to you whenever you want help. When we asked for oven mehmet provided us with a new oven just in the next day!       Marmaray metro station is just five minutes away from the apartment by walking, you can easily reach the city center from this station in less than 20 minutes!    Moreover, if you would like to enjoy the Bosphorus , there is a very beautiful park next to the Bosphorus shore just with 5 minutes walk distance!    Finally, the havaist station which drive you to istanbul airport is about 3 minutes away from the apartment!       I would definitely recommend Mehmet apartment and would stay in it again whenever I’m in Istanbul. Nice large room..   Great location Excellent host   Cleanest possible place   Very communicative    Gave local tips   Only issue is the quite disturbing noise level around the place. Thank you so much Hikmet for everything. Lovely room, wonderful view from the window, amazing terrace, great area. Hikmet is a responsible, responsive host. I was in Istanbul for the first time and made the right choice. Special thanks from my children. They were delighted to be visiting this house. -very central position. With 2usd to 5 usd taxi fee all amazing places in range. With 1.5 usd taxi fee we have visoted water garden. So much cafes resturants. Lovely.       For bus station around 5 min walk; metro station is around 10 minute walking distance.       Residence has own supermarket; resturant also.both great.       House is the most clean place till I have (Website hidden by Airbnb) is more clean than 5 star hotel rooms.       Kitchen is fully equiped. Very very interesting to reach all equipments on a rental house. We stayed short but reccomend to stay long.       Night view from panaromic windows are great also. I will miss that view. great location, and spacious apartment especially for 2 couples or a group of 5. communication was clear, great host and very helpful. I'd recommend it as I'd stay here again. I recommend every one to rent this appartement. Was really amazing and clean Perfect! We had an amazing time in Ahmed and Obada's cozy home.     Obada was travelling so we got to spend lots of time with Ahmed, we will always remember the great conversations, laughes , cheese games and your delicious food.     Thanks for everything.    I am sure everybody will feel super happy if you choose to stay here. :) This truly is one of the best places to stay in Istanbul. The accommodation is located is 5 minutes from the Şışhane metro station, 3 minutes from the Galata tower, and 12 minute walk from the  Karakoy ferry. The staff in the accommodation is super welcoming and nice, everything is really clean and the Wi-fi works perfectly. Best bang for the buck, and would definitely stay again at this place. The place was spotless clean. Easy check in and check out. Very close to metro, shops and restaurants! Spacious flat with all the amenities! Would definitely stay there again! Ayten & Ercan’s place was great and we would happily recommend it to anyone. Gökhan was a great host. Nice and easy to communicate. He was answering very fast! I felt safe there to stay alone.    Everything was like on the photos. Clean and well decorated. Wifi connection is very good.   The location of the flat is also great. Walking distances to İstiklal Street, Cihangir, Karaköy, Galata Tower etc. were only about 6-10 min.    Another great thing of the flat is that you can use the laundry room (washing machine & dryer) and you’ll get detergent for free.    Highly recommended! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️   Greetings from Germany! A truly amazing stay. the Host is wonderful and accommodating. 5 min walking away from the heat of besiktas a livley and amzing place. 10 out of 10 do recomend. The room was oké it was only a little bit to small for 2 persons. And in the beginning we had a lot of trouble with a certain cigarette smell in the room and the walls are also very noisy. You can hear neighbors next to you and even above. Altogether is the suite good located 2 minutes from the tramstation Tophane. Also in the same street you will find a lot of supermarkets and a coffeeplaces. This suite/room is handy when you need something cheap and you need to be quick in the centrum of Istanbul. This Apartmentis awesome, you have to see it yourself. Amazing stay at Peter’s flat in Galata. Comprehensive amenities, incredible views and super communication are just a few of the many highlights. Great host, great house. Would recommend without hesitation The place is a little different from what it looks like in pictures, the location is cool although there is a lot of noise, it is right next to taksim square. Clean Rooms. Near to the sultan ahmet mosque.    Friendly Host. Everything was fine, the hotel is very near to the city with shopping locals and pubs or clubs. It was very clean and beautiful. Thank you!      Kind regards      Gentiana Great location and great stay Amazing place for a great price. In the Center but most importantly not noisy ! AC very effective and you have the most amazing sleep. Clean up services every two days or up to demand. Very nice host who is always there for you even sometimes after 12 pm. All to make sure that you’re comfortable and you got what you need. The Apartment  is - as indicated - in a very central place in Yeniköy. I enjoyed very much to sit on the balcony and look at the Bosphorus and to drink a beer in the cafe just under the balcony.    Nilgun was very helpful and friendly for the arrival, to find the place (which is quite easy) and for recommendations what to do, where to eat and so on in Yeniköy and around.   Thanks a lot to Nilgun, I spent a wonderful weekend in Yeniköy. We stayed there 7 nights . It has an amazing view and terrace. It is very cosy and felt home! Location is great right next ti Galata tower. wonderful place, a strategic point between all tourism places, excellent place, recomended 1000 % Amazing apartment! Very good location in the heart of old city. Clean and comfortable. There are a lot of restaurants and shops at the nearest. It was great Great boutique hotel! Best location in Istanbul. Volkan is very nice host, always friendly and ready to help. There is not much to say to be honest, Location, Property, Facilities everything as described and killing part is the view. Wake up in the morning to see amazing sea was fabulous. Everything in the apartment was  as described clean and tidy. I am sure that Sinem's place is always first priority for the future rents. Thanks again The place was fine. I really like the area you can get easily to everything. The apartment was excellent and the owner was friendly and always wanted to comfort his guests Betal’s flat is lovely. Clean and tidy. It's well located and well communicated, 15 min walking from Taksim square. Betal is a great host, he helped me a lot during my stay at his place! I would recommend staying at his flat. I had an amazing stay at Imans apartment.  Both he and his wife were always helpful when I had questions, and answered super fast. The apartment itself is nice and cozy and very close to Taksim Square,  just a 5-minute walk. The apartment got everything you need, for cooking, a nice comfy bed, couch and a big TV. Everything was really clean too.  Shops and a bus station are always right in that area. I definitely recommend this place. And I will definitely come back in summer Good apartment and convenient location. A fine restaurant just across the road. The rooms are clean and atmospheric. Apartment is rather compact, but has everything necessary and provides good comfort. The terrace on the top floor is great for a self cooked breakfast or a pleasant evening. The staff was very attentive and helpful! Awesome place. The place is very nice and in a good location.   Agnes is an amazing guest. She helped me a lot . She recommended me about nice places to go   and even helped my with my laundry.   I enjoyed vey much to be her guest. The apartment is in a wonderful location. It's near the metro and so many wonderful cafes and restraunts. The apartment is cute and cozy. Check in was easy and Kenan was kind enough to offer his help whenever needed. I highly recommend staying here and would come here again! This place is great. The location is perfect and the place is clean. I highly recommend. This apartment was perfect for our week-long stay. There were so many small details to make it a comfortable place for us. While it's close to a lot of the attractions of Istanbul, you still get to be immersed in a more local neighborhood. It's in a dense area but mornings and nights were super quiet. And the bed is comfortable so you can get lots of good sleep after long days of walking around. Helen, who is the local host when Julie isn't there, was wonderful. She gave us lots of helpful tips and helped us get settled in. The apartment has a couple of convenience stores on the same block and there's a wonderful outdoor market very close by. All in all, I highly recommend! Perfect location for a stroll through Istanbul’s old town near Galata tower. The place is beautifully furnished and well thought-through. The bed was comfy and the AC was a big plus. We’d happily come back to stay at Ali‘s place. This is a very nice place to stay. Everything as advertised. Eddie is an amazing host who's always there to assist you with any queries you might have. The location is great as well- it's just a 5-minute walk to Taksim Square. There are many shops around together with some very trendy coffee shops and bars. And it is definitely value for money. Good location , very pleasant host, helped and advised places in Istanbul.    Recommend this place, will definitely stay next time :) We really enjoyed this place and the neighborhood.    The apartment was super stylish and cozy. :) Thank you! Hello,   The landlady was a very caring, kind lady. The house was very comfortable. I will definitely choose it for my next trips.    Thanks It was my best ever experience staying in Airbnb. I enjoyed everything - from the room with a nice and cozy view to the amazing home atmosphere Öykü created together with her sweet cat Isis.       I spent the whole month in this apartment (including working from home due to restrictions in the city) and I can definitely say I felt like I am at home.       The area is just amazing too - morning or evening 7 min strolls to the heart of Ortaköy or weekends walks to neighbor districts Arnavutköy, Bebek or Beşiktaş - enjoyed all of it. Plus if you'd like to get to the historic center - you can easily go there by bus or by bus and tram. It would take up to 20-25 min. And don't forget to go to Yildiz park which is only 15 min walk from the apartment. I am sure you'd like this green oasis in the heart of the city too :)       I really enjoyed staying with Öykü in her home - she is an amazing host and now my dear friend. And she has also become one of the reasons why I am planning to be back in Istanbul soon.  :)       I truly recommend Öykü and her cozy home! I am sure you'd enjoy it as much as I did! I had such a lovely time at James place! The place is very spacious and beautifully designed.    The are tons of cute details about the interior Design. The place is very central.      Lovely detail: There is an italian Coffee pot in the kitchen so you can make your own Mocca coffee there!       The communication was great too, when I asked something James would reply immediatly and send his assistant; Hilme, who is super helpful and very kind as well. I had a problem with the shower once, Hilme was there in less then 10 minutes to solve the problem.      Overall, I really recommend this place! The place is Just redecorated. I found it classy. Super Clean and helpful people. I'd recommend. Lovely flat, centralized location and great communication. I would totally recommend! Very nice place! Good communication!! All ook! Nice view!! Lovely apartment with great views. The garden opens directly onto the historic complex of Bucoleon Palace. You can have breakfast in the remains of a real 9th century colonade built by Emperor Basil I. Ali is very hospitable and quick to answer questions. Highly recommend. Great location, walking distance to public and major tourist attraction sites.    Very very good hospitality. The hosts assisted us identify places to visit, including good spots for dinner.    Very good spa and Turkish bath on location.    Definitely staying there again. very well located the room is really warm when you enter after a whole day but from the moment you turn the AC on it gets fresh. place is nice and good location Great place, located few metres away from Istiklal street, and very cosy apartament Temiz ve güvenli bir ev, her istediğiniz şeylere yakın, samimi bir host... Ben bu evi 100% tavsiye ediyorum herşey çok güzeldi!      If you want a clean and nice stay, which is also located in a place that has everything to offer what you need and great accessibility to the public traffic and a friendly host, then go ahead and book your stay here! The place is totally amazing, strongly recommend it. Located in the beautiful district of Karaköy with wonderful streets. Location is close to the metro and city center so it’s quite easy to get there. The best thing in the apartment is the terrace. It has magnificent view on the city and Bosporus. Very kind and helpful host! Good location close to taksim square and lots of shopping options! Great man! Amazing house, i didn't have any problem while staying there, everything is working as expected, really recommended even for group travellers The apartment is located in a beautiful place in Istanbul. The host is very affable and always open to help. The apartment is very cozy and comfortable. I definitely recommend this apartment. Very nice place, well equipped, in a quite neighborhood with a small park very close.   M.Recep and his family do live in the same building, and they are very helpful. If you need anything you can ask them for it.   M.Recep speaks English, making discussions with him possible, which is not that common in Turkey. I did enjoy the little discussions we had.   There are bus stops and Dolmus nearby.   I highly recommend. the apartment is clean, comfortable area, as described.  thanks Fikret! Good location We had a very nice stay at Zalal's place - the view is phantastic! General: Great host, adequate room and facilities, excellent location, oldish building.      The great...      Location: 5/5, near ferry, buses, grocery shopping, etc.       Host: 4.5/5, Kubra is a meticulous, ultra-sensitive, intelligent and charming host, busy at work during the day. Flexible and reasonable too. I enjoyed the generous company of her long-term renter,  musician-craftsman Nebi and the peculiarities of yogi-physical therapist landlady Kubra. Because I am eccentric, I found sharing her home to be a good match.      Quiet: 5/5, Having lived in Malaysia with its loud dueling electronic calls to prayer, I was relieved to discover that at this place I did not wake to the pre-dawn azan at all. You can go to Uskander for that. I rarely even heard the call.      Bed: 4/5, Sympathetic to my need for a firm mattress and a duvet w/ cover, Kubra switched originals w/ hers. A single (twin?) Bedding was OK.      The neutral...      Dining area: 1.5/5, no table, eat at desk in room. I did not like this as it seemed anti-social and cramped. The other tenant, who has the mid-sized room, did offer me to sit at the little table with chairs in his room, but it felt strange doing so. I didn't want to intrude on his 'space', even when he was absent.      Enough space: 3/5- 5/5, a bit crowded w/3 persons during evening and weekends. WC not an issue, but food preparation and fridge space was a challenge (context: I cook a lot). Counter-space to prepare vegetables was barely enough. But I am a kitchen hog and I create more dishes than anyone else on earth. Good thing is both Kubra and Nebi are gone during the weekdays and Nebi is gone almost every day, so I had the place to myself most weekday daylight hours.      Non-smoking: 4/5, Nebi smoked only in his room, very little and/or  with the window open. Not an issue.      Porch: 2.5/5, Not so relevant during winter, but come spring it could be put in order and made into a pleasant sitting area. It has potential to be more than a  storage area that looks like a suburban garage. Good thing is that there is plenty of clothes line space.       Room: 3.5/5, small and very little easy-access storage space. Well-lit w/ natural light also      Heat: 3.5/5, Adequate for room heat. Shower hot water excellent. Zero hot water in WC sink. Mediocre hot water in kitchen sink.  Not-so-new Russian 'Ariston' system used as needed. You the renter will be responsible for controlling it for the whole apartment.      Security: 3.5/5, Not keen on neighbours sometimes propping front door to building open, and if it was my place my policy of safety would be to keep door to apartment locked even when inside. Plus the room has a minimalist hook which can be used only while inside (and it pops open in the middle of the night). And, it's a bit inconvenient stooping down to open front door latch. Don't know how pensioners w/ back problems do it. Since Kadikoy is not Tarlabashi I did not feel at risk.      Social: 4/5, some might find warm and witty Nebi, the long-term renter, bringing guests over to his room for tea and music off-putting because it increases WC and kitchen use. However, I enjoyed meeting his friends. Raki anyone?      Garden: 3.5/5, scraggley fruit trees and mystery shed. Cats like it. Summer might bring vegetables.      Other: 3.5/5, there were a couple of plumbing and electrical issues which more or less were resolved.      Conclusion... Keep in mind the bargain price and that this is a home of two persons in their 20s and 30s whom I suspect are 'scraping by'. In fact, Kubra's home reminded me very much of my room rental in Canada for the past six years. The operative phrase is \"necessary compromises\", that is for the landlord to rent out the smallest room on Air BnB and convert the dining/living room into another bedroom. In both my Canadian and Turkish places we accommodated each other out of mutual financial and social interests. Both places had no dining room table and were rather cramped. But it's win-win. During COVID lockown eating out was not an option. Plus, I don't like living alone and presumably Kubra wanted some supplemental income.       Many other Istanbul Air BnBs are businesses with landlords operating multiple places - hotels and apartments really. At Kubra's you are in a real shared home in a quirky part of town. I do recommend her place. Just have realistic expectations. This is not a businessman's hotel. Very Good experience and professional.   I would fully recommand. Mehmet is an amazing host and a very nice person. The room is spacious and quiet and located very close to all the best places in Kadikoy. I enjoyed my stay a lot and can only recommend it. Amazing! Hospitality at its finest! It made my short trip well worth it, as well as it being in the best area . Love love love :) would book again The location is central; 12 minutes walk to Taksim or Shishane metro stations and one minute from the bus stop. Staff were friendly and helpful. I would go there again in winter as it was too hot in summer in a small room. Volkan is super nice and hospitable. Great location! The apartment is renovated and comfortable. It has great location, very close to Galata Tower and Istiklal street and also close to the Galata Bridge from where people can take boats and go anywhere. The neighbourhood is calm, with cute caffees, restaurants and stores, which makes you comfortable to walk home in the night. We had a very comfortable stay at Eray's apartment. It was very clean and convenient. There is everything you need so you feel like you are at your own home. It's a short walk to public transportation and the neighborhood is central and lovely. Feeling the local atmosphere is a plus. Totally recommended for any kind of travellers. Everything was good. We had a great time. Thanks! Very nice place in heart of Istambul. Great room, cozy but comfortable Highly recommend this airbnb! The location is great, close to Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia and tram station where you can go wherever you want. The host is helpful and stays always online to help you.  The apartment is really ok for 3 persons, it was enough space for us. We used the kitchen in the mornings, everything worked well. If you're looking for a nice place, well located and a host who makes you feel like home. You definitely have to come here. Perfect stay This guy sajjad and his wife are very nice and cooperative. The location very central every think is near by and Taoism squire is just 5 mint walk I would definite to stay here again Highly Recommend Great location Ceren’s place is very cozy and close to Taksim and has an array of amenities.The whole experience felt like being at home and my host was attentive to my needs and very sweet. Beautiful apartment and great view. It is walking distance to Akyaka Park (mall) and 2 grocery stores one on the way to the mall and one in the Akyaka Park. It is also 5 mins drive from Carpark mall  and about 8 to 10 min drive to a very big mall called Buyaka AVM and Meydan Istanbul AVM.  You will love the place I did. The little balcony is great to eat with friends, room is more spacious than I thought. Heating is great for cold days, there's a small kitchen if necessary.      The location is very central as well.      Only problem is the door to the balcony gets some wind in so if its cold and windy, it's impossible to prevent this.      And there's constant music in the hallway, the rooms aren't sound proof enough to keep this sound out. It'd be better if there wouldn't be any music at all. Anil & Ece make your stay in Istanbul as effortless as can be, they make check in easy and give you absolutely everything you need to know for your stay in Istanbul.      The place has a really good location, within walking distance of a lot of the attractions and metro stations :)       Thank you Anil & Ece for all the help! great hospitality good location everything just went good Musa and his brother Omar are very helpful, kind and decent. The location is few minutes from Taksim Square. For the price the room and the location are reasonable Fantastic stay, in a great neighborhood near lots of local cafes and restaurants. Very cozy feel to the apartment. Amazing owner, wonderful flat, location top!          W (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) w, highly recommend! Friendly host and spacious bedroom Nice Location, great view, good communicating Host Such a lovely, home-like place...   The place is exactly as shown in the pics, restaurants and supermarkets are all over the area.   Over our stay here, Aren was always one click away, always there to help and respond in no time.   Overall, we loved ittt and we definitely coming back. There’s no word can express how lucky i was to choose this apartment, i had wonderful days there starting from the host hospitality until the apartment view , the place was so clean and fresh , everything i  needed was there alot of pillows, blankets,  and all the kitchen equipment  were completed, It was more than enough for 8 people and the place is wide and well ventilated that was my favorite part ❤️    Ali is really a gentleman i gave him a hard time by asking alot of questions but he was so patient and  cooperative with me . His family were so hospitable and nice to me . I appreciate that .    I won’t hesitate to book it again in the future ... Missy is fantastic. She will help with whatever you ask, flat was cleaned to a high standard. Would recommend 5* What a beautiful place to stay and helpful service . Location is great, room is very small. Shower only works for the handheld head and all other features do not work. Receptionist is great and helped me with all my requests. A perfect location from Taksim square, just a 9-minute walk & maybe 6-minute walk to the metro station. Superb location   Very cooperative lord    5 star comfortable rooms    Very clean apartment Friendly and good-hearted I stayed in this place around 2 weeks. the location of this place is great, and it's very silent and quiet, even though there are many restaurants, cafes, supermarkets and other places around with a lot of activity. The wifi is fast and reliable for any purpose but doesn't reach the bedroom very well. The place is extremely hot since all the heat from the building is accumulated in here, and there's no fan or AC so you need to have a high tolerance for heat to stay here. The shower is very low and you have to shower on your knees, unless you are lucky to be a dwarf, and also the water temperature is ok, but not hot (if you like super hot showers). There is no elevator to get to the 5th floor. The place itself is nice and spacious, the kitchen is nicely equipped (even though i didn't cook much). The bed is comfortable, and the host is nice and left some nice details at my arrival. The place seems very safe and the appartment has a very interesting style. Volkan is just the best! Couldn't recommend his place more. Great location and super helpful with all my queries. Also Ali is very nice! Helped me with my luggages and other things. I would definetly stay here again! 5 stars! The place is quite nice and the host is very helpful. They have a coffee maker and a laundry room which is nice. However I found this place overpriced. The room is much smaller than is appears to be, the furniture is worn out, and the whole building reeks with cat piss and cigarette butts. Make sure you noticed that the the kitchenette is not inside the room, it’s the common area in their top floor. Cozy and clean apartment with a great location near Istiklal street.    Dilek was very hospitality and advised us to visit some interesting places. overall great value for the money, nice location out of the touristy path just a little walk to get to the Hagia Sofia but a little harder to cross the river without taxi or tram. great place with air conditioning which was huge Overall great experience! Mehmet is really supportive and communicative which always makes Airbnb stays better. Beautiful views from the penthouse. Just wish the bed was bigger! Murat is helpful and communicative. He was very kind to share his internet password with us and all his food in the fridge. Location and the view is great. Markets and etc. is so close. Even though the apartment is central it is in a very quite street. The rooftop is amazing. The apartment has all the essentials you need. Location, location, location. This apartment has a primo location. Galata tower is just foot steps away from your apartment. In a building with no elevator, you will have to climb 3 flights of stairs to reach the apartment. Once you arrive, you are greeted with a tastefully decorated apartment. Comes equipped with just about everything you need. Given its location, you would think noise would be an issue but I can confirm it is not. It is tucked away in a side street with a coffee shop next door. The apartment is very nice and comfortable! Location is very convenient, near shops and public transport. Baybars was very helpful and friendly, he’s a super host! Be ready to climb stairs and get a lot of aerobic exercise :) Súper Excellent! The place was in the best location because you are close to everything in Istanbul walking distance. You have the best places to eat at the best prices near and very good stores that have good things and are not expensive. The place is peaceful, clean and quiet. And the staff including Mr Ramazan are very nice and attentive (they are very respectful and make sure you have a comfortable stay). I would come here again. We were only 4 days in Istanbul, but we liked everything. The apartment was clean and everything is as in photographs. There was only one bad moment, we arrived, the day before discussed what time we would be, we were a little late because the plane was late. But in the end we waited 3 hours, because the host was asleep and it was impossible to wake up him. In general, the apartment is clean, the plumbing is also all clean. The area is really not very quiet and you have to sleep with the windows open because there is no air conditioning, but this is the center of Istanbul! And the price is quite low, which made us happy. The apartment had a cooking stove and a washing machine. We rarely saw the owner at home, so everything was quiet in the apartment. I recommend Mahmut as a host if you come to travel. its really a nice new place, clean and has an easy access. it has all you need.    i would come back again Parvin was very helpful and direct host. The place was clean and cozy. Location was accurate and we stayed without any problem. A vibrant street, a million great restaurants, easy walking to the ferry, the bus, the subway, the tram.       The real beauty though is those amazing windows.  180 degree of view.       The sun doesn’t set on this apartment until the last dogs died.       The loudspeaker on the minaret in the picture works very well Location how it is described and it was nice to have supermarkets nearby ,especially during lockdown .Great view from the terrace, wish we could have used it more but it was rainy . Check in was super easy thanks to both . Only we had an issue about cigarette thing on the bed which was super weird coz we don’t smoke cigarettes at all and we received the messages about it after 4 days later of our check out. Apart from that Highly recommended you stay here. This apartment was Beyond my expectation amazing view ,clean and organized. I loved it Everything is perfect, he helps us a lot and he’s very communicative. I recommend a lot. Excellent location, an ideal place for a couple. The AC was the cherry on the cake during hot summer.   The communication was excellent with our host : thanks for the experiece ! Very good communication, very nice flat. We had a little garden where we could dry our clothes. The location is on a hill so keep this in mind. Very friendly and helpful guy was looking after us who speaks Russian, Turkish, English. Local shops just outside the flat with kind and friendly workers. Close to cafes and close to Istiklal street. Bermall is a perfect host and so helpful! We felt like our home. The place was so clean and warm. We are so happy to meet with Bermall we want to go back to the place another time. I had a great stay at this place. Bomonti in general is a nice and trendy area to be in. Close to the city center but yet not as busy. The place itself has all the appliances needed for long or short term stays. I highly recommend Tugba's airbnb. She's very friendly and responds in timely manner. This place has an amazing location, right next to Taksim. The place was very clean and Al was always receptive whenever we needed help with anything. Great location, clean, nice view of the water. Communication was seamless and easy, would highly recommend. its good hotel  The house is clean, good location, big room and excellent host Nice cozy room, Host are very helpful. Close to vadistanbul mall. We enjoyed the stay there. Amazing experience! Felt like home. Everything was on point. Hosts are very cooperative and friendly. Value for money! This was my first time in Istanbul and it was amazing. Eyüp’s place is great as you see in the pictures. Is well located. You can walk to main attractions. Eyüp is very helpful with tips and quickly respond to any questions. I totally recommend stay at his place. Thanks so much Selman. Really good kanka, the experience in Istambul was amazing. Great place..very pleasant stay and nice area... Would easily stay again... Very nice host and pleasant human being :). Mr kemal is one of the kindest person i met , he is very helpful and always making sure that his guests are completely comfortable, the apartment is very clean and cozy , and also has a great location there is many restaurants just few steps away , overall I highly recommend it great location in residential neighborhood, cozy space, everything we could ask for, it was a great space. small notes: for those that may be traveling with parents, there are 3 floors and an attic which could be challenging to go up/down stairs. getting the water the right temp in the shower takes a little getting used to and there's no AC. for us, it was perfect but a few small things to keep in mind! Excellent place!! It is as in the pictures, super spacious, super clean, amazing location, plus Taner and Nicola welcomed us when we arrived despite the late plane and the time we took to arrive.  You have a bus stop that with bus to everywhere 5 minutes by foot. You should not hesitate this is a gem! Very good experience Great location, apartment is fully renovated and its super clean. Our stay was a great experience Small but cozy room with an outstanding view to the galata tower. Clean room and bath The apartment has everything you need for a long stay. It is clean and well equipped. The location is convenient. The apartment view is lovely.   Omer is gentle. He is easy to communicate with and responds fast.   In short, everything is great. Engin is very nice person. I highly recommend his apartment. Yasin’s place was clean , not noisy and great location . I loved  balcony view of the city and also area around the apartment. Yasin was a nice person , he was responding on time ,  responsible and patient , he waited 3 hours for us to get there from Istanbul’s traffic and check in . Definitely suggesting his place . Alper's flat is an amazing place. In the heart of lively Kadiköy but very quiet day and night. The flat was perfectly clean and Alper has been very helpful. Communication with Alper was easy and he was always available when I had a question. I highly recommand his flat. And there is a surprise on the rooftop! This place is in one of the best spots in kadikoy, with easy access to everything. Also the inside is well decorated and welcomes you the moment you enter. For me staying at Yusuf's place is like living in the place I've always dreamed about. Wonderful two weeks and my best stay at Airbnb.   The building is nice and clean, the small cozy lift takes you up to the top 6th floor and you are home again. The place itself is wonderfully decorated, clean, and spacious. All the details are the ones you can stare at and examine for hours. Interior keeps the touch of history, as there are original wooden floors and doors left. And that magnificent collection of books. A book lover like me can just spend weeks attached to these bookshelves and never get enough. There are a lot of English ones also. And a lot of nice home plants)   As for the facilities, the kitchen is really well-equipped and the bedroom is also cozy with a good bed and comfortable mattress. And it is such a joy and inspiration to wake up in the morning to that light coming out of the windows of the living room. Really keeps the spirits high) There is plenty of space for 2 people to work remotely with laptops and wifi is sufficient for 2 parallel video calls. And the collection of vinyl and stereo system made our chill hours awesome.   The neighborhood is absolutely the best with a sea 2 minutes away down the street, metro and ferries 15 mins away, a lot of coffee shops, good breakfast spots, and others. I loved to get down to the Monkey coffee next door in the morning and take a stroll along the seaside. We loved Yer for breakfasts and Suvi Mutfak is the absolute best if you want to taste some healthy food:)    Gals are so funny, imitating the cats. And cats. They are simply the best:) Perfect spot to spend the night and its near by many things. It is nice for a short stay beside the airport the apartment is located on the third floor in the very center of the historical center, it takes 5-10 minutes to get to the new sights, there is a shop on the ground floor where you can buy everything you need. There is also a veranda with a beautiful view of the street.   the disadvantages include cleanliness in the apartment, the drains in the shower were dirty, and the shower itself is not the most convenient. and on the veranda on the second day they found a cat with kittens who lived under the sofa and did all their business there, so it smelled rather unpleasant and were quite aggressive Great value for money. Hilal is a very nice host, quick to respond to any of your queries and very accomadating. I would recommend this place. Nice living room with a view, easy contact with the host, and convenient location ! Enjoyed staying at this place so extended our time here. Cem has given real thought to furnishings and the building is a treasure trove of interesting pieces.  A pleasure to stay. This was by the most beautiful place Ihave stayed at in Istanbul. No hotel will ever compare to this location and the views. The home was clean absolutely spotless clean and everything inside was high end and new and clean and it had all that you needed to feel at home. Beautiful brand new dishes and all things needed for cooking and plates and cups and glasses and etc. It had in unit washer and dryer and lots of big towels and AC and amazing views from all direction. It was quet and serene. It was worth every last penny We loved our stay here. The space was just as described and Zeynep was very helpful. We also found the location to be perfect. The rooftop view was also excellent! The apartment is nice, clean, quiet, has all the basic needs and is close to most of the tourist attractions, only if you have heavy bags you will have some difficulty in climbing up the stairs, other than that, you will have an upscale experience Wonderful apartment in an outstanding location. Close to the most vibrant centers of the city and close to transportation network. It’s also 7 min walk from the seaside! Bulent was very helpful and responsive throughout our stay and checked on us everyday. Will definitely come back here again. This place is absolutely amazing! I really enjoyed my stay here. The host is amazing they reply right away if you need anything at all for your stay and have it for you within minutes . They were kind enough to give us a short tour of the city and we had a super late check out ! Our flight wasn’t leaving till midnight and they were kind enough to let us keep the room for the remainder of the day so we weren’t stuck outside waiting all day! The arranged an airport shuttle as well. Wifi is a good speed and they have you access to their Netflix on tv as well. I highly recommend it The location is great! It's close to markets, cafes, local bazaars, close to metro stations, bus stops, the sahil, and more! Everything was just a walking distance, the house is great for short stays and despite it being in the basement floor, it still gets a lot of sunshine. The host was also very kind and always checked in to see if everything is alright and if he can help in anyway. Overall a great place! I highly recommend the place. This is an amazing place to stay during your visit to Istambul. I stayed here for 4 nights and I had an excellent reception and care of everyone of the people working here.       The cleaning, rooms with air conditioner, excellent view (what a view from the terrace, seriously) and the service of washing clothes are excellent.       And of course the people... what can I say about these guys... they are just awesome! Not all they speak English, but I will never forget all what they did for us. They made me feel security and calmness.       The breakfast was delicious and more than enough for all the energy we need for visiting Istambul.       They helped me even with the Covid Test I needed and now that I remember, after coming back from Capadocia, they gave us all our money back because we decided to stay one day more than planned in this other city, but in Marmara Guesthouse it wasn't a problem. I even didn't ask for the money when I came back here, they gave me in reception and for me that was important.       I recommend totally this place. You won't have doubts pf comming back here.       I congratulate all the stuff of Marmara Guesthouse for the excellent work they do. Thanks again, guys! Had a nice stay. Clean and big room, nice location. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The only thing I’d complain about is the fact that the door wasn’t soundproof and you could hear all the noise from the hallway. The apartment is just like the pictures: it’s quite small (but enough for two people) and the location is great. The rooms are quite soundproof so me and my partner were able to make zoom calls simultaneously and not hear each other at all. The wifi is ok, again, we could make two calls at the same time, but using internet on 3 devices at a time would be a problem.       The host was great, always answered quickly and even recommended a restaurant for my birthday and it was delicious.       Check in and check out we’re easy and didn’t involve any personal interactions, also there is only one apartment on each floor which feels safe.       All in all I totally recommend the apartment for 1-2 people if you’re okay trading off the smaller space in order to get an awesome location.       Galata tower is really 1 min away, Istiklal street is like 5 min away, same with the subway station.       Really enjoyed our stay. TOP NOTCH! ♥️ great apartment and a great host, everything is provided for you and the host is a msg away, for sure going there again Thank you for providing everything we need. Beautiful large, clean apartment that is well equipped. The area is very nice with lots of restaurants, cafeterias and supermarkets. We recommend   Everything is as same as photos. Host is polite and friendly. Thank you so much!   You were so welcoming and helpful :)   I really liked your place!   You have a great team and a great project, and really nice apartments) This place is ideal to spend time with other people from different countries. I liked the place, clean, cozy, owner is always ready to help, recommend to everyone! Aysun's place is exactly like it's shown on the pictures, tidy and stylish. It was clean and it is obvious that Aysun takes consistent care of the flat. At first I was uncomfortable because the room is on the first floor but soon realized that the neighbourhood is a very calm one, inhabited by families who have long known each other. The location is close to downtown, about 25 mins by foot to Ortaköy, but there are some stairs and steeps. Aysun was always very quick and  responsive, before and after the booking, and quite helpful too, when I needed tips and guidance. She's has a straight-to-the-point approach. She is understanding and nice and I am glad I chose her place! I enjoyed statying at Mustafa's. The location is really great - cafes, shops, transport and sea are available to you within a short walk. The room was a bit old and untidy, but bathroom as promised was always clean. Also to my dissapointent, AC in my room didn't work, however, Mustafa kindly provided me with the fan. AC in living room worked fine. Actually, communication with the host deserves more than 5 starts. Mustafa is very careful and attentive to his guests, he helped me a lot when I got sick on holidays, which was very sweet of him. This apartment is great for a short trip to Istanbul. It’s located in Beyoğlu near the Galata tower and it’s a hip and youth area. Ece was really nice and always helpful. Definitely recommendable! Great place in the best part of Istanbul with easy access to all you need! Arzu was very helpful and even  assisted in ordering dinner upon our late arrival when everything was closed.   Would definitely stay in Arzu's place again! I recommend this room, the vie is really beautiful. You have everything you need close to the house.    And the guesthouse are amazing, Fatima it’s very nice and welcoming.   You will be not disappointed. The location is near Taksim and Istiklal street, which is really good. The host is a very helpful and quick response to all problems and worries that I mention to him. He provides everything that I needed during my stay. The wifi is not strong. If you want work remotely it is not work for you but for tourists and visiting it's support. The amenities are enough and suitable. Overall it is such a reasonable price by being in the heart of Istanbul. zehra's place was super nice. great location, nice view, lots of light and super clean. would definitely recommend :) The location is great . there is a lot cafes under the park , big supper market and pharmacy  . the park has nice swimming pool and big garden . the apartment is wide , panorama view , 17 floor and well equipped. but need more kitchen tools for cooking . Transportation by taxi is easy , metro is by taxi 10 mins . need 40 min reach taksim by taxi . 10 min walk to 212 mall . the air-condition in living little bit week .   the owner is excellent English speaker , helpful and trying to make you comfortable    Definitely,Recommend this apartment NO need to shop around, Deniz's place is great for short and long term stay.  No worries about the location, quiet neighborhood  and absolutely great place in term of interior design, clean, quiet, spacious, fully air-conditioned for summer, and centrally heated for winter, and many more to be mentioned here .... visit to see it for yourself.      I was communicating with Selim, thank you for everything. Impeccable location, super cozy property. Asil is super helpful and quick to respond. Great This chic AirBnB studio was decent. It came with a small kitchenette that was convenient to whipping up a quick breakfast before heading out to explore.       The location of the studio was perfect, right in the heart of Taksim square and walking distance to Karaköy and the metro AND a 6 mins walk to a Covid testing Lab.      Ismail, the host, is easy to communicate with and he assisted us with transfer to and from the airport! My partner and I enjoyed our stay here and we recommend it 100% Özgür is very nice and friendly, I had a very nice stay with my family there. He welcomed me personally and helped me with the luggage. You really feel home in Özgür's place. The location is great, and very close to the sea and to the historical areas. Definitely recommended for long or short stay at Al Fatih area. This is the best Airbnb in the entire world.       Ilkay- the host- is very welcoming and hospitable. He deserves an award.       Your time in Istanbul won’t be complete with a stay in Sisli with Ilkay. Excellent apartment, has everything you need to stay for a few days. ive stayed in 6 places in istanbul and this is by FAR the best place! faultless - absolutely recommend. Perfect location, easy check-in, wide apartment. And ideal host! Obada, thank you much for your assistance in everything. It’s very valuable when you are in unknown city. Now welcome to Russia and Israel! Будем рады видеть!) Perfect cosy studio for couples or a single person. The location is incredible close to everything. The reception guys are very helpful and speak good English . Highly recommended for the value and the stay.       Thank you Guys charming apartment with nice decoration ,good value for money and near to taksim       special thank for demir for his hospitality      i recommend it This is a great place to stay. I was a bit hesitant because of a couple of the reviews, but it seems people are looking for a luxurious 5 stars hotels when they are not paying for it. The place is located in an amazing spot of Istanbul,  it’s private, the staff was always helpful, the bed was comfy and there was a lady that went to the room to clean it once a week. The internet is not the fastest but it does the job. I could do my zoom meetings without any issue. I would stay again! Thanks guys! Great location. The house is good for 2 people and can fit 3 easily. Good amenities. The internet was excellent for remote work, calls and streaming Netflix. The street is calm and the neighborhood is great. It’s close to taksim and restaurants. Definitely recommended. Deniz and Marco are very friendly, helpful and hospitable. The apartment is located super close to Galata Tower. The dining room has space for eating and sitting on a comfortable couch in a sunny spacious room. Three bedrooms ensure the intimacy of all guests. I would definitely recommend this place. Nice and clean place for a short trip! Very nice apartment: luxurious look, beautiful design, comfortable interior.  Very friendly hostess! Berna’s apartment is the most valuable place you’ll find in Istanbul. It’s in taksim which is the most visited place and you can find tons of restaurants and shopping places. Also the apartment is near the metro station just 9 minute walk. Amzing flat, amazing host ! I recommand and will definitely go back to this spacious and well located apartment ! Nişantaşı is an upscale neighborhood with all shopping, dining and health care in a walking distance. Just don’t come with a car as parking can easily overwhelm you. If you don’t mind flight of stairs getting to your apartment this flat is excellent for long term stays. Thehouse cafe a is a name brand establishment in turkey that you will find in your backyard. Don’t forget to check out the city’s mall only a block away! Great place to stay, rooms 10/10, staff 10/10 and common places also 10/10 Had a great stay! Everything was great, the pool, super clean apartment, everyone was super nice. Would for sure stay again Thank you so much for welcoming us and helping us through    You are so kind Mia is a great host and her Airbnb is well located. It's close to many restaurants, supermarkets, markets and walking distance to many other attractions. There is an on site manager that is always helpful and available to solve any issue that I had. I would recommend this place and stay again in the future. Thank you! This stay has a magnificent view of the Galata Tower that can be enjoyed both privately within the the unit's balcony and just above the unit on a shared terrace. It is centrally located enough that we were able to save on taxi fares and take a ~45 min walk across the Galata Bridge to see Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque. My only concern is in regards to privacy -- in the bedroom right besides the bed there is a poorly frosted glass wall that separates another room (presumably in the adjoining unit). This coupled with no soundproofing made for an uncomfortable rest at times. Otherwise it was a fun stay. Emre's apartment was great! Very large, has everything you could need. The location can't be beat, we were able to walk to all of the most famous attractions in Istanbul. Great place to stay, really clean and modern apartment! The stay was perfect. The appartment was as described&on pictures, well-equiped and with a nice seaview from the balcony. The owner was very nice, showed us an awesome restaurant and important spots to visit. We were there on our honeymoon - and we loved it :) Great location, room and bathroom tooo small. Room not very well equipped, there was no mirror, bed is quite old and not very comfy. Internet connection is tooo slow. Also, there was no replenishment of water, coffee, napkins...   The employee Emir is very helpful. To me the place doesnt seem small as others say.Its perfect for 2 people. Close to the bus stop. Cheap food in the area. Close to the change office but rates arent that good sometimes. Kitchen with everything. Close to the ferry . Awesome in general would come again. Emre's place is perfectly clean, comfortable and stylish, and is situated in a nice and convenient area of the city. The view is amazing.  Emre is very helpful and responsive.  We really enjoyed our stay. Highly recommended! Müfi & Selo's place is everything we could hope for! Beautiful, clean, central and classy. The view on the terrace is absolutely mesmerizing, we tried to have breakfast there every day. Musa is a professional host and had a great communication with us during our stay. His apartment has a great view of skyscrapers and the city and also has a great location close to everywhere. Great apartment, clean, good location and communication, I can only recommend.(: Perfect Airbnb, full of coziness. Everything was just like the pictures, and even better. Next to markets, cafes and monuments.   Valit was a perfect host, responsive and always kind.    Thank you again Valit.   Totally recommend it. Thank you so much Nice apartment with a nice view on the quite place the oner was so good Perfect stay The house is lovely and has small beautiful garden full with flowers and fruits . The host Ahmet bey and his wife are very nice people, we enjoyed staying there a lot.  The house has a perfect sea view and can walk to the beach 10 min and watch beautiful sunset also. Highly recommened. Good for this price Ali was an amazing host. He was more friend than host. Oh my God! The whole time I was there I was depending on him. It has nothing to do with his job but he help me out with everything. Whether I was ordering food, riding the train or talking the cab drivers for me. He was always there to help.       God bless his heart he’s a wonderful person. Thank you Ali Location is very good, shops restuarants and all parks are just at the corner of  street. Hassan is very helpful and nice person. we had a great time here. the kitchen and bathroom had some issues, there was no door on the bathroom but otherwise it was great. the location is perfect, we recommend visiting the restaurant with the umbrellas near the apartment. Unfriendly host Very good service, cleanliness, cooking and the price affordable by all. Good view and location. So glad I booked at your hotel and for sure will be back soon. Simply everything is great. Wonderful full equipped apartment in the center of the city with the spacious terrace.    Ozan is a very helpful host, reacted very quickly to solve our problem! Nice communication for the whole stay in Istanbul!    The bed was very comfortable. It was a little bit cold in the  apartment, but it didn’t disturb so much.    The apartment is very cosy and has an artistic touch.        I would prefer to stay there next time. It is a room in a hotel. The room was clean and the furnishing was really nice. The hotel is in a central position, 2 walking minutes from Galata Tower. Only thing we did not like was the breakfast. Highly recommend staying there! Building looks like old but inside of flat is amazing. Host was so helpful. Location is really central and close everywhere It was good value for the money Very clean flat and the host was always very responsive! The views were beautiful! Highly recommend staying here. Over all good experience :) Nice clean apartment in a perfect location, close to everything, plus the host is so kind and responsive . Thanks Apartment and host are nice. Everything is clean and new. Small gym inside the building. Tiny pool and sauna. Sauna didn’t work properly during our stay. But we used the gym with great pleasure.   One big minus is location. There is no any supermarkets, grocery shops, cafes and restaurants around. Across the street is huge poor area. So should be careful. Clean apartment in a good location. Customer service was friendly and area was quiet. The kitchen was not well equipped and wifi didn't work very well. But host tried to help us with wifi. Thank you to Mr.Talal and everyone that works in that building from security to room service and so on.   We had a really nice stay in that cute and clean apartment.      The apartment had everything from A-Z..   Other than that Mr.Talal was available 24/7 so we never worried about anything.   Many Taxis  and nice people who like to help.   I do highly recommend this stay for family's especially !   I will visit this apartment again asap ! Definately a place to be so stylish and convinent as it is near most historical places like galata (Website hidden by Airbnb) is almost near taskim square by only a 5 min walk. Perfectly located apartment in the heart of one of the greatest neighbourhoods of Istanbul! It is a new building, well decorated and equipped, clean and really spacious. The garden and private parking below the apartment is also a great addition to the accommodation. Overall, really satisfied with my stay and would definitely recommend it to others! Very good location! Friendly host, clean apartment and good location. Perfect location to stay in Moda and Istanbul. Quite peacaful street, close to the all attractions and seaside in Kadıköy. Host is helpful and easy to communicate. I recommend here. Great location. Very cost effective. Wonderful place! Only but is that “Parking on premises” turned out to be parking on the street. Luckily wonderful host Mustafa, helped us to find a good spot for our campervan. Furthermore we enjoyed the room and especially the rooftop a lot! We felt very welcome by Carolina too. Thanks for having us Thank you Enes for everything! Very nice apartment. close to a shop, pharmacy, cafe bar..Parking is near and cost 40 tl . The location is in a popular touristic place. Although the building is not in a good state the apartment is quiet good and looks fresh. Osmann met our when we arrived and all time was on touch. Perfect location and wonderful views for anyone who loves to see Istanbul from the rooftops. The apartment Is on the seventh floor so beware there are quite a bit of stairs to climb and no elevator. Other than that it is a great value fir the money and the hosts are super accommodating! Greater location of the house, near there are a lot of interesting cafes, bakeries. The apartment is very stylish with a beautiful view of Istanbul, plenty of space, a comfortable bed Beautiful location, and AMAZING terrace. Best place I've stayed in Istanbul- highly recommend Very nice place in a good location. Hosts are super nice! Çinar was an amazing host, he helped me since minute one before checking in and when checking out. Always in communication and close by when needed.    The location of the flat was perfect to me, everything close and minutes walking. You have two keys, one for the apartment and the other for the building when closed at night for more security.    Highly recommended! I stayed at Araz place for 35 days.    The location is amazing. Very close to public transportation. Taxi is always available by request at the lobby.    There are 1 big grocery store under the building and 2 others at 5 minutes walking distance. There is a nice bakery 2 minutes from the apartment for some fresh baked goods.    Pharmacy and hospital are also within walking distance in case of an emergency.    For international travelers that needs PCR test for flying back home there is a hospital next to the apartment within 8 minutes walk ( Private medical park Hospital) that do PCR test and the results are ready by 6:00 pm if you get tested before 11:00 AM for 250 TL.    This saved us a long trip to airport.       The apartment has a magnificent view. Sunrise and sunset are so beautiful. Whatever you need in an apartment is available. The place is very quiet and safe in case you are traveling alone. There is 24 hours security at the lobby and no one can get into the building without a pass.       Araz communication and availability was very nice.    I would highly recommend this place and would stay again here for sure.       Thank you Araz . ☺️ great location, beautiful  neighborhood. Its a good place to stay, near taksim square and near mini market Thanks! I enjoyed staying here so much! The apartment had all that I needed, was perfectly clean and cozy. AC is working nicely. High ceilings and lots of windows make this place extra.   The location is great, 1 minute from the tram station.   The owner is responding quickly, procedures of checking in and out are all set. Matt is so thoughtful, gentleman, he is always willing to give me any help. The best house Owner I ever met and I am lucky to stay in his apartment for my first trip in Istanbul. everything was great!  the apartment and the location are wonderful ❤️ You will  find always bushra and jamil  by your side in same time they respect your privacy and sometimes you will have the opportunity to eat together and discuss about Turkish culture Very clean and as described! Neriman’s place is wonderful place to stay in, me and my partner loved it. The location is just by the Galata tower, we could see the tower from the rooftop plus all important cultural buildings can be seen clearly. The panoramic view takes your breath away.   Restaurants with high rankings are on your footstep at the exit of the building, and the grocery shop is a short walk distance.   Neriman is one of the best guests I have ever met, she welcomed us at the alley and showed us all the essentials at the building. She is generous, gave us free water, coffee (different types of them), and tea.   Before getting to istanbul she messaged us with how to get to her place and made sure we arrived safely with minimum cost.   During our stay she messaged us to check on us. At the checkout she was there to say goodbyes.   All in all, We had a blast of a stay, that I would highly recommend for anyone visiting Istanbul. Yassin is a very nice and respectful person. Everything in the house is nice and clean and the location is comfortable. I hope to come again Great apartment, very clean and fully equipped with everything we needed.   The host was very helpful and answered our questions on the spot.   Check-in and check-out was very easy.   Overall it was fantastic stay, highly recommended! The apartment had an amazing view and the location was excellent. The host was very informative, nice, and responded quickly to all my questions. Highly recommended! :) The appartement is so nice and calm and the location is near to almost everything .. the host is cool and the communication with him is easy and he’s there 24/7 for help and answering all questions ..   Definitely will considering going back if not to the appartement it will will be for the host very good. nice host. perfect location. so clean. no complain. Great location I like Aysun's apartments very much. It's big and very nice, very good room and comfortable bed. I like this region too. It's not far from Ortaköy, it's easy to use bus or taxi is very cheap.   I didn't meet Aysun, she has holiday. We was talking by whatsup. But she was very helpful with some things. Hello,      I stayed  in Günay's place  for more than a month. It is a big,bright room with big window getting much sunlight, equipped with necessary furniture. Check-in was smooth and it was easy to find the location.       Roommates were all nice and the appartment was always quiet. We had a cleaning plan and everyone was doing it on their scheduled time. There is a dishwasher,which is a big plus.Kitchen is equipped with everything for cooking.Questions or problems are communicated in group chat between roommates and assistant. Assistant is friendly and tries to solve everything as quick as possible.      Location is central and near  main transport,like metro and ferry and in short distance to other touristic districts. Grocery shops are nearby.        In general it was a pleasant experience to stay there. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this flat. The location is great and it's quiet too! I slept without earplugs no problem. The flat is clean and the kitchen has all the appliances you may need. There is also an iron, an ironing board and a hairdryer. The check-in and out is very easy since there is always a member of staff present in their office which is only a short walk away from the apartment. The only downside is the wifi is a bit unstable so when it wasn't working I had to revert to hot-spotting my 4g. Medar staff was excellent!    Perfect location  Concierge service was excellent.    Thanks for Beka for helping us in making several reservations for us.   Room was clean and cozy!    I would highly recommend this place  Seda was an incredible host. Very generous and helpful with everything I needed. When I rented her place, air conditioner was not listed, but she went out of her way and fixed it for me without extra charge. Apartment is cozy and the neighborhood is great. Shopping is just 3 min walk. I highly recommend. I’ve been staying in Aydan’s place for almost 3 days , the location is very convenient , Aydan and her boyfriend are very nice and understanding. The room is very tidy and clean , the kitchen is well equipped , the living room is chill and cozy .       I highly recommend Aydan’s place .       Cheers . Great place! Close to malls. coffee. groceries. Most of all great internet! I was able to work from here online without any issues or concerns. Clean. Comfortable. Reliable. Communication by Ahmet and Marjorie was on point. Loved it! If I ever come back to Turkey, I would stay here :) very good place   great location   very advisable to select this apartment if you visit Istanbul We came to Istanbul in spring to discover this fascinating city and to work remotely. This flat was the ideal accommodation for us. It is as lovingly decorated as seen in the photos, very clean and comfortable. The central district around Istiklal street, as well as the main metro line, is within walking distance, yet the apartments street is very quiet.    The WiFi was fast enough to work directly from the flat and grocery stores are just around the corner. The host is very helpful. She gave us fantastic restaurant recommendations and also recommended a co-working space which I used for an important meeting.      In short, definitely an insider tip and worth every cent. I recommended it to other friends. The place and location are awesome, everything was perfect! The apartment was great. Exactly how it looked like in the post, and very cozy place to stay in.      The apartment is relatively small, but enough for 2 people. The only downside was the apartment is in a strap area (to walk to Istiklal Street, you'll have to go uphill and it's kinda tiring - but this is generally how it is in the whole area so you need to get used to that).      Overall, would recommend it to a friend and would stay there again. There are only few times in life you meet special people and meeting Hüseyin has been one of those times. Hüseyin does his utmost best to be a inclusive and open host. He is a chill, relaxed, good hearted, and very trustworthy and honest human being. He goes out of his way to accommodate your needs. His home is cozy and comfortable. His location is convenient and close to major attractions of Taksim, Galata, the Bosphorus, and more. Hüseyin is not just a AirBNB host to provide a space for you to lay your head, he becomes a tour guide, he will join you in showing you bars, clubs, restaurants and more. He is also a good cook and opened his home and heart to me. No doubt he will make this happen for all who come to stay with him in the future. To Hüseyin: I did not only get to experience Istanbul for the most the city offers, but I gained a friend in you. Thank you. Excellent location next to the promenade, with lots of restaurants, shops and playgrounds nearby. The apartment was well equipped with everything needed for a month's stay. A simple apartment, not fancy.  The location is good, but there was no soap or toilet paper. perfect location. nice garden. helpfull host. i highly recomend. We enjoyed our stay in this apartment. It was clean, spacious, tidy and is located in really good neighboorhood. Close to Istiklal street, Taksim square and metro (about 8 min walking). All in all, it was a great apartment. If I had to give some ideas for improvement, then I would think about thicker curtains for the big bedroom. The current curtains are too thin and see-through. If you are sensitive to light but want to sleep in in the morning, it is kind of a problem. Also, the smaller bedroom has no airco but a ceiling fan. It would be great to have an airco as it can get warm and stuffy there. But these are no big issues, we found solutions to these problems like putting a sleeping mask on and leaving the door of the small bedroom open for better ventilation. This is why, I still give 5 points for this apartment. This was a clean, spacious and comfortable apartment. I was pleasantly surprised by the size of it. The bathroom was a great size as well. Check-in and check-out were extremely easy and the apartment is very central to popular tourist areas. My only complaint was the noise and bedding. Bedding was slightly uncomfortable and the neighborhood was extremely loud. Especially the birds. Other than that, I enjoyed my stay Very authentic place in REAL Istambul. Thanks a lot to Ilhan to made our stay comfortable. We had a wonderful time in this flat. In a group of 4 people, we were able to make excellent use of the entire flat. The whole flat is beautifully painted bright and has great light. A large dining table for breakfast together, or the huge living room for board games or Netflix evenings. The two bathrooms are in a great design. I know the hotel and flat standards in Istanbul - this is luxury!      Highlights:      1. directly above us was the roof terrace where we could see the Golden Horn and enjoy some sunsets.       2. the location. We could walk to the hotspots and rarely took the metro.   As Istanbul is huge, the taxi drivers themselves don't usually know every street name, so it was really handy to live so close to the Galata Tower - everyone knows it and it makes communication easier.      İnci was so nice and offered us her help several times. Thank you for a great time, we loved visiting and will definitely be back, very soon! Beautiful flat, with amazing view. In a great location. The room is lovely, clean and with a nice view on the Mosque. Wifi and AC work just fine and the terrasse is exquisite ! Recommend 100% Amazing location! Easy check in. Great value. A bit noisy street and water heater. Great location, Balat is a wonderful place to spend some time while in Istanbul. Apartment was great, everything we needed and close to all of the local attractions. Great hosts that were easy to get a hold of and very helpful! very beautiful house and clean at very best place of Istanbul with cultural neighborhood and next to wonderful innocent museum. Forgetting the memorable moments of this house is impossible. Omer was a great, responsible and available host like a friend. Celal was amazing! He helped me since the first moment with transfer from the airport, great communication, the place is really clean and cozy with and incredible view and location. He even allowed us to check in later while waiting for us with warm Turkish tea. I recommend it 100% Amazing place. Will definitely recommend. Nice, small apartment, great location, near you have all you need, grocery, café, baklava shop   Engin very kind and hospitality, told us how to get to the flat from the airport and always asked if we need any help) The location is perfect. So central and close to everything you want to see in Istanbul. The flat is great and everything works just fine, and the host is very helpful and responsive. I highly recommend it! super nice place. would definitely stay there again Hotel is located near all main sightseeings, close to public transport, has many cafes near. Owners are very kind, always ready to help, rooms are cozy. I loved this place! The location of the hotel is very central.    A prettier house than in photographs.   I was very pleased with the cleaning and other things. It was a good experience. I recommend it to everyone An amazing apartment with the nicest view! It was perfect for our stay a bit further out from the city but it is the best place to relax and unwind! It was clean with basic amenities  provided The staff are incredibly nice and helpful- even provided cleaning equipment when we asked for it! It has local supermarkets and restaurants downstairs which are super convenient! We couldn’t use the pool and the gym that are in the pictures because they were closed due to covid. Thanks for hosting us in your beautiful apartment, the view was excellent, location is within short distance from Restaurants, coffee shops and bazar, everything matches the advertised information. A Family wise and comfortable apartment . A clean place and upgraded.       We enjoyed our stay and for sure coming back  in the future .    Faysal was very helpful , and he responds Fast to our requests .    Ali very good communicator , and he was quick to  action.    Thank you guys see you later  :) Everything was good. House was very clean, very stylish, very located and very well designed. I had quick connection with Pelin. But there aren't main heater system. There were small heaters but can a little inadequate in very cold weather. I recommend to stay here. The apartment is specious and comfortable, fully equipped, walking distance to all of the tourist attactions. The host is very sweet and loves his guests. Brinf your own toiletries. Amazing apartment and terrace, best view in the city so far! Highly recommend! We booked 25 mins before checking in. The response was fast. Thanks to Ferhat. Great location and typical Turkish flat. Okan is a very nice guest. Great location with a great view. Everything we needed was there. We didn’t even had to contact Emirhan for anything. The location of apartments is perfect! It’s 3 minutes walk to Galata tower and all European cafes to take coffee and nice breakfast and about 20 minutes to historical center.   The apartments as such are quite comfortable. It’s a little bit noisily inside because of busy streets and old windows but you can adapt.    The only thing I could recommend to the host is to renovate walls and some furniture, because it seems not to be new. I can’t say we would like to cook on the plate and use equipment, there were no washing powder and capsule for dishwasher. The hook in the bathroom is broken and all of this leaves not so fabulous impression as it can be.    So, it’s strong 4 for the accommodation. Stylish apartment with a masculine touch. The location is Amazing. Close to restaurants and coffee shops. Communication with the host was excellent and quick. Would stay here again. Fatima is a kind and caring host. She responded immediately to my reservation and had no problems communicating as long as I stayed at her home. Her house is in a very central location. There are many cafes, restaurants and markets on paralel street. You can access bars, pubs and nightlife in 10 minutes on foot. A house in the social attraction center. You can also access ferry, metro and bus in 10 minutes on foot. Its location is very good in terms of access to public transportation units. The house was old but clean. The items inside were also clean and new. It’s really nice located and clean! Perfect stay for few days in Istanbul. place is good overall experience is good. rooms are not that big which is shown in the picture. how ever it's value for money. Great apartment, friendly owner! I advise everyone Great location. Hardly 2 mats to Istikal street. Facilities exactly as mentioned. Hope to stay more in the future visits. Nuray is an excellent host & was very easy to communicate. Thanks for the hospitality Nuray. Can runs a very clean apartment located in the heart of besiktas. Overall our stay in this apartment is very pleasant. Ilhan was absolutely great! He earned his super host status. Great communication, location, check in process and apt. He went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable including adding curtains because I complained about the sunlight. I was in Istanbul for some purchases and he was extremely helpful in this process by suggesting suppliers. Place is clean and 5 min away from the major shopping st. Istikal. Many restaurants/ bars/ corner stores within waking distance. But the neighborhood itself is quiet so that's helpful when you are trying to rest. Taha (Illhan assistant) was also reactive and helpful. Overall a great experience for my first time in Istanbul. Would def recommend and come back. Thanks Ilhan. Great place in great location. It's a nice place to stay and the host is a very nice woman, she helped us and treat us a homemade \tliqueur. It was a bit cold in the room, when we was there (it was about 18° outside). Notice that it is a room in host's house with it's own entrance, not the separate building. There is also no curtains so you don't feel fully private. The location is good for the beach, but a bit far from ferry, but you can use a bus. This has been an excellent Airbnb experience overall. Clean, trendy apartment and also very secure. The check in was smooth and straight forward.       The only issue we faced was the fact that taxis won’t take all the way to the property due to narrow allies, so if you have heavy luggage that would be slightly cumbersome. However, if you follow the exact detailed description provided by Emre, it will be much easier to find the place with less hassle.       Emre has been a great host, and has been very responsive to any questions or requests. The area is very lively with nice bars, shops and restaurants and close to Taksim and Istiklal as well as the main metro station.       I would definitely come back again too Emre’s place. Outstanding place and location to be staying at in Instanbul. James definitely goes out of his way to ensure a smooth stay and is prompt to response to all inquiries. I very much enjoyed my stay here and would strongly recommend the penthouse to anyone. This place has a strong character and definitely is made to amuse and leave an artistic experience  for guests. Nice and clean appartement on good location! Excellent host, good communication. Apartment is spacious and clean with all amenities available. Altuğ's place has a great terrace overlooking the Bosphorus and all the geometrical shapes of Istanbul. The living space has a sweet spaciousness to it. Altuğ is very good at communication. Recommended to fellow travelers. good stay...could improve on the condo conditions...especially with shower flooding, we struggled with that one quite a bit. I really enjoyed living in the historic district of Istanbul in a cozy and atmospheric Muzo apartments!       The location is ideal for exploring the historical part of Fatih Istanbul. Within walking distance of the Bosphorus Bay and the ports of a river taxi (Balat and Fener) from where in 3.5 lira and 10 minutes you will cross the strait and find yourself on the other side, next to the Galata Tower and a permanent cafe on the embankment of mackerel in pita bread from Emin Usta (exactly the one who everyone calls Super Mario). Within walking distance from the apartments Hagia Sofia, Sultan Ahmet square, many old streets and authentic establishments. The walks every day brought incredible and varied impressions.      Muzo is a very responsible owner, always quickly answers calls and messages, helps with any questions, so do not hesitate. In addition, not far from the apartments, Muzo has his own restaurant \"Makarri\", in which he is not only the owner, but also a wonderful cook (by all means try everything from the section \"Specially from the chef\" - you won't regret it!). Muzo's Turkish coffee is one of the best in the area - 100% recommendation!      The apartments have stable hot water supply and, if necessary, heating (I was in January here and sometimes turned on the battery, it turned out to be very helpful). On the floor there are 2 shared bathrooms and a large kitchen with everything you need. There are not many rooms, so there were no difficulties with using public places. Every day the lovely woman Aisha comes and cleans all public places. There are a washing machine and a tumble dryer. So order and cleanliness.      I'll make a reservation right away, you need to understand that this is not a multi-star hotel, this is a micro-hostel with personal apartments, where people from all over the world stay. You occasionally meet in the kitchen, spend joint evenings over some board games or just a cup of tea in a conversation about the morals or differences of your cultures, preferences or just the news.    For me, it's a bingo: outside is the historical Istanbul - walk and walk again, inside - the international community. We arrived after midnight (we told him about it), and he had a mistake with the number of the room, so we woke up other guests when we arrived. Finally, when we found our room, there was no information about the Wi-Fi password (in fact, a really bad one).   Moreover, we were 6 people and there were just 2 toilet paper and we had to ask for more, but just one more was given to us. It was the same with the towels, there were just 3, and the bathroom had a really bad smell with a bad quality shower.   We also tried to use the washing machine but there was no detergent.    The positive things about the apartment were the location, the comfortable beds and the downstairs bar! Beautiful place wonderful terrace and view.  Communication with host was easy before and during the visit. He helped us with info how to find accommodation, where to eat etc. We hope to come to visit this place again someday. :) Asli's apartment is really comfortable for you with family or friends to enjoy your journey. It is very clean tidy well eqquiped with applicants and kitchen instruments.  and she is very beautiful and warm hearted. It was a very good apartment, the rooms were very clean and well maintained. I enjoyed staying over there. It’s also in the center of Taksim square. Will definitely recommend it to other people Lack of elevator and toilets wet, leaking on 2nd floor apartment. Stunning view ,lovely neighborhood! House was beautiful with a great view. Had a very nice layout and the rooms were also very spacious. The amenities were also very useful in the house as well. Very good place, good conditions and excellent location. Ebru was very friendly and helpful while checking in. The apartment is in a very nice neighborhood and close to many nice restaurants, cafes and bars. Great, stylish place to stay. Amazing view guaranteed! Perfect location! Rooms are spacious. Very clean. Helpful reception staff. It was a big pleasure to live here. So nice and cozy house with plants, in great location, with beautiful view from window. Andres is very hospitable. He gave me advices about transport, places and food. His flatmate and friends are interesting people and they are ready to take you and to help. Zafer is a wonderful host with a super-dedicated approach and outstanding attention to detail. The apartment is even better than on photos with everything in perfect condition (and with a beautiful view). 100% recommend this option to everyone visiting Istanbul, especially if you fly trough SAW airport. For someone who had visited Istanbul earlier this place was just what we needed. The location was in a calm place but still close to cafes and restaurants in the area around the Osmanbey subway station. It was less than a 10 minute walk. What exceeded our expectations were the hospitality of Basar. Always quick responses. Always with smile on his face (as imagined through the texts). And always willing to beyond expectations to make sure that you were having a good time in Istanbul. Highly recommended. The apartment is like the pictures, great location close to the important places to visit and quiet neighborhoods. Mehmet is very nice, good communication and always try to help you with everything. I highly recommend. Ismael is a perfect host. The apartment exceeded expectations. Location is the center of the center.      Thank you for everything Ismael      Youssef It was a brilliant apartments with terrace on 4th floor! We enjoyed it very much. Besides, Sercan was really kind and friendly. He helped us to find locations to visit. I certainly recommend this apartment! The location is near Taksim square! Everything was great during our stay!    Terrace had a fascinating view. Every evening we enjoyed it :)      Thank you very much for such a great vacation! Kerem place is very good, and well decorated. It is comfortable for a long stay. Kerem and his partners are very kinds and always there for you. They asked us often to clean the place. The location is very good. Very good place Great and authentic flat with amazing view to Istanbul and close to lots of local restaurants, cafes and shops.    Also the host is very polite and friendly. You’ll have a great time at this apartment. Great location, employees and apartment Rukiye is a great host. The place is clean and calm for stay. Really good emplacement and flat, Serhat is reactive and friendly. I recommend ! Really nice apartment, nicely designed with a great location really close to galata tower. Couldn’t have been better. Apartment was beautiful and equipped with everything we needed (and lots of lovely touches / local design). Don't need to mention about the view. A panoramic view of lovely Bosphorus which will blow your mind! Hakan is such a friendly host who tries his best to make your experience unforgettable. No need to think twice! We will never forget! Nice Place to be :) I stayed in a different apartment,  which was even better. Betal is a very pleasant and thoughtful host, you can definitely rely on him.    I would stay at his place again! House was great  for a holiday The apartment is nice and cosy, the balcony view is amazing. We spent all our evenings there!    It’s is absolutely good place to stay at while Istanbul trip:) everything was great. The house is located in tge historical part of tye city next to metro and tram. Recommmend! The place is great, it looks exactly as at the photos and the location is perfect. Semih is also a very hospitable and responsive host. I enjoyed staying at his place very much. The building is very old , there no parking in the building, the elevator not working very good , but the apartment has an amazing view, many things near you Very clean and cost room ! You can find everything in room ! I will recommend Hüseyin is an excellent host, he was available around the clock and is very hospitable.      the apartment is very nice, location is great, it really felt like our second home.  The Sahil is walking distance, as well as the marmaray train which can cross between the Asian and European part       The apartment is well equipped, but if you have allergy with cats it might not be for you, personally we like them and the children love them being around. The apartment is amazing, very clean and with a beautiful view! The owner is very helpful. I can definitely recommend this apartment. Thanks for everything, David!        Absolutely amazing host. Thank you so much for taking care of us. You're place is stunning and we absolutely love our experience. I highly recommend this place as one of the best stays in Beyoglu. Nice cosy flat... had all the amenities necessary for few nights... communication with the host was brilliant as well... but... the flat was located next to a road which wasn’t so pleasant at least not in the morning. In our opinion this appartment is the best one to discover Istanbul - lot‘s of Bars, Restaurants and Shops around. Also it is easy to find and reach all famous sights from Istanbul. Caps are available as well.       The hosts were very helpful and die communication was easy.       We would choose it again The images at least before 2 years ago at least.       We were in honeymoon and asked him for cancellation and will pay the night before and cleaning fees but he refused.       He suggested other hotel which he own with big high difference in the prices.       Overall Hasan was a good person but dont talk with him about money. I believe hisn’t AirBnb he is hotel owner  Everything was what I expected. Very satisfied. I would recommend booking with them. Thank YOU.  Beautiful space and modern apartment. Amazing location with everything close by. Hosts made the stay super easy. Nice cozy place with superb location. Onur was a joy to talk to, quick responses and helped us with transfer.   Pretty nice overall. On the first day, we were refused check-in at the hotel and offered instead a terrible room nearby, in disgusting condition, dirty, small and with a lack of sound insulation. It was impossible to sleep, we were on our honeymoon and my wife had a birthday the next day. We didn't get enough sleep, from an infinite number of cars and a neighbor who watched TV all night. The rest is spoiled, I do not advise you to visit if your nerves are dear to you. This place is perfect. Great location, very close to the tram and Metro, lovely and clean, the wifi is fast, and the view from the terrace is a huge bonus. We loved our stay here. Hatice’s is great in all the aspects- location is close to the center and transport nodes, the house is full of light and was very clean, communication with Hatice was very easy and prompt and of course the view is superb too. So I plan to stay again, and can recommend to all first time and frequent travelers to istanbul. quick response, very helpful. made my trip smooth and easy The place and service was amazing. I highly recommend this place. View is amazing, location is perfect. They welcomed me even with drinks and food which is always good after a long trip with plane. Apartment is very comfortable and beautiful, i felt like at home. It was quite valuable experience we had, the host was already kind and communicative as well as helpful. The amenities mentioned were also clearly true. I appreciate the host and I’m planning to have many visits in the following times. Hello,   we stayed for 9 nights here and the answer to \"would you stay here agian?\" is \" NO \", i am sorry to say.   We found the fotos not realistic at all and that made us a not so charming first Impression. What you see and smell ! directly after is, the house and the apartment is realy realy old and I mean it not in a good way.    We were disappionted to see that it was not even clean. Or maybe was clean long time ago for fotoshooting !   Here some hints if you decide for it;   - it is quiet central at literally a few meters from blue mousqe so you have all you need around you.   - it is or gets very laud due to 2 or 3 mousques nearby and their very loud speakers !   - the host ist very helpful and reachable in case you need help   - you can eat a very delicious turkish breakfast directly across the alley.   - the wifi at house is not reliable    - water supply is problematic in the region so it can get shut down occasionally. We had it just once for half a day during our stay. Nice big apartment in a great location Good location, spacious apartment with all you may need. Swimming pool and a gym inside is a big plus! nice place for tourist place is very near taksim saquer and istaklal street just 3 minuts walk and evrything. close by carfour big local super market name şok u can buy local prize grosery very quiet place i hed great stay apartment dor lock was very good safe place The apartment is beautiful, cozy and unique, i recommend it.. Lida is a good comunicated person and she likes to make frnds Özgur's apartment was very nice and  clean and in a very good location (only 2 minutes on foot to Galata tower).    Özgür was available at any second when I wanted to ask something.   Overall, it was a very nice experience, which I would easily recommend to anyone. Lovely place to visit and great views (I was on the top floor). First time is slept in a circle bed before so that was fun. Inside was nice, albeit a bit pokey.  Definitely fun. And great location near grand bazar! One of my favourite places in Istanbul. Had a great stay with Mondo! The comfiest bed in all of my trip! i didn’t want to leave! lol. Felt very welcomed, comfortable. great for a one or two night stay for transit. or even longer! She’s also very responsive via messaging, she’s nice, funny, and just overall a great host. book with confidence. On of the best Airbnb's I've stayed in for a long time. The apartment is so authentically Turkish it gives you a feel for the culture. Was very clean, and he view from the top of the building is immaculate. It is steps from Galata Tower and the Galata Bridge. Many places to eat nearby. Only downside was the neighborhood can get a little loud at some points. Overall 5/5! Nice apartment for staying for a few persons (2-3). but for the bigger company, it may be not so good. Good style of apartment and quiet place. near apartment, there are a plenty of shops/places to buy something It's a great place. If I'm back in Istanbul, I'll stay here again. Emin Is really kind and helpful person. He takes care of guest needs, always ready to help and make your stay delightful. House location is great, house is really clean and Every thing to enjoy the residency is prepared.    Definitely recommend it! No Comment. Everything is just perfect :) Excellent location, responsive host, great and spacious apartment, unique decor, the bed, and bedding is comfortable.  One thing to keep in mind, it's on the 4th floor of a very old building, with no elevator.  If carrying your own luggage isn't a concern, book with confidence. Really nice place, very well located, really close to diferent places such as Taksim and Besiktas, it is also close to the trolley where you can easily get to other places like the Big bazaar, there are some market's near it where you can buy food and there is also a good bakery right across the street. Also the apartment was very clean and Harun helped us a lot, he always made sure we felt at home and have everything we needed. We would definitely stay there again and recommend to other people. strongly recommend this appartment that has all necessry for comfortablable staying! The biggest advantages: cleaning every 4 days and perfect location ( 10 min to the main street Istiklal ). Thank you !!! Small room with perfect location. Too small to live with 2 people but alone it's ok. Comfortable bed but mould on the walls. Great working A/C. Quite nice place , Host is very helpful. Strongly recommend A good place and location, only hated the stairs , but the host and security guy was very helpful and kind We really enjoyed our second stay at Nazli’s place. After spending three weeks in January we decided to come back as it was all worth it. The apartment is really great and located in a great calm area with a lot of places to go. Nazli, as always, was really helpful with everything and made our stay even better. Great host. Always available when you need. :) Nice and very welcome person  i extended 4 days more he is very helpful    The location is perfect   Will come back for sure    Thank you for you everything Ecem is a fantastic host. Very accomodating and friendly. She will make sure you have everything you need. The location is amazing - public transport, cafes and shops are basically at your door step. The apartment itself is very nice, clean and comfortable, with amazing views. Highly recommend this place. Thank you, Ecem, for an awesome stay! Apartment is quite good - you can find there enough space for 4 people and everything you need during your stay. It maybe be a little bit loud from the street, but at all location is great - near to all touristic places. Night view from the terrace is fantastic. I recommend Cihan and his apartment to all visitors :) it was a good value for money and very close to the center of istanbul.... host very polite. Great location and nice place. Will recommend. First class apartment in a great area. Beautifully decorated, comfy bed, kitchen well equipped. Spacious bathroom. Zehra was always ready to communicate. She was very clear and friendly in the check in process. I do recommend this place if you want to treat yourself in a great neighborhood. Staying at this place was such an exceptional experience for us. Although it was a short stay we loved every single detail of this place. Location is just great, view is breathtaking. Taygun has been a great host and made our stay so comfortable, thinking all the details and making our life so easy. I would love to stay here again and would highly recommend. I really enjoyed the hospitality of Umut and his family. His mother was super supportive while I was finishing a big project and spending a couple of afternoons in the room working in my computer. The room is comfy and the apartment is cozy, which is expected with the price. The apartment is 10 min away from a handful of subway and tram stations and also from s bus stop for the new Istanbul airport. We had a great time and the host is great! You will defenetively enjoy your stay. Clean comfortable apartment, really very comfortable bed, good location, wifi works great. Recommend) Great location, service and value. The staff are nice and the place is clean. The only issue I had was that there was only a very small window in the room (duplex) which was not ideal as I was working from the room during my stay, and the room was dark. If would return without hesitation if I was sure to get a room with more natural light. Kemal was great host. He did all he could to help us in making our vacation as good as possible. He answered all of our questions quickly, arranged transport from and to the airport and kept our luggage after we checked out and before we had to go to the airport. The apartment is big and it was good that all three of us had separate bedroom. And as soon as you leave the apartment, there are touristy streets with shops and restaurants and tourist sights. The place was good. Bathroom was clean but there was some odor. In general I would recommend for a short stay :) It was a pleasant stay in this great apartment in quiet peaceful area, apartment was spacious and clean, thanks to host for great hospitality. we stayed there for a month while working from home. the place is perfectly located in nisantasi, with grocery stores and the metro nearby. the apartment as an elevator, which is a huge benefit gen moving luggage. the place is very clean, however here is a VERY strong sewer smell coming from the bathroom. we had to keep the windows in the house wide open o let air circulate in. Also, there were 3 of us working from the apartment and the wifi couldn't support 3 people. oh 1 person could be in a meeting at a time and even then, the internet speed was very slow. I wouldn't recommend or working from the apartment. however, the internet is perfectly fine for watching Netflix or browsing social media n the phone. the apartment is in a great location, comfortable with AC in every room, comfortable beds, plenty of blankets, has basic kitchenware. overall, I would definitely stay again. Fabulous place surrounded by great history. We loved our friendly and sincere experience we had by staying at this beautiful place. Deniz was the best in showing us everything we needed ! Special thanks to him. Staying at Ozgur's Airbnb was one of my best experiences in Istanbul. His place is gorgeously decorated, clean, and in a perfect location. He introduced me to some amazing experiences in Istanbul that I would have never thought of otherwise. He welcomes you to your home and is very accessible if you need anything during your stay. I was traveling alone and I felt very safe being there. Highly recommend! Riza's place was lovely. I had a grate time with my couple and we had nice wine talks looking throughout the window at night looking at the city landscape. U can see a bit of the bosphorus, which was kinda cool :D gracias Riza, well stay again most likely Place is good, though care about the tap water We had a nice stay at this place. Location is very close to Taksim square where the airport shuttle busses arrive. Also it’s a walking distance to Galata tower and Kadykoy area. But the building located in inner district, so it’s a real local life on the streets what I found interesting to witness. People doing their stuff, kids playing on the street and so on.   Some nights were noisy from the street, but some are not. So it might be an issue if you are very light sleeper.   The apartment is really cozy and good equipped. It maybe looks a little bit older than you can expect from pictures. But definitely it’s cozy and spacious. Good internet.   It’s on the 3rd floor and stairway is a bit steep and narrow. But host helped us to bring our luggage upstairs.   The communication was good and fast, Gurubish helped us with some advices.   And the view from window in dining zone is amazing! Definitely worth the price. The place was nice for a short term stay, has most of the essentials. It's on the first floor with a kind of public outdoor space right outside the window so if you want privacy you have to keep the curtains closed which makes the room quite dark. Plenty of space for one or two people, comfortable beds. Close to all nightclubs and coast Excellent apartment and Lisya was very helpful! Thanks for everything! Very comfortable space where you can spend the day without getting bored during quarantine :) Taner and Nicola were both very kind and helpful, we enjoyed our stay. Thanks a lot, Bora and Gulsha! Your hospitality is unmatched! I felt at home and enjoyed all the great conversations. Watching soccer together or joining a beer on the balcony made me feel like a local.   Bora and Gulsha's place is lovely. It has an amazing balcony with Bosporus view and is quiet, clean, spacious, and calming. Charming coffee shops and grocery stores are just around the corner. It is only a two or three minutes walk away from the lively town center (Besiktas). A Dolmuş (shared taxi) brings you to Taksim Square in around 10 to 15 minutes (for only 3 TL).    Highly recommended! I would definitely come again! Stay was great, and location amazing. Communication was fast, and would definitely recommend :) Very beautiful and clean  house, only the outside is a bit noisy as it is located near  the main road. Baris was extremely helpful. I got locked out and he helped me within minutes. He also helped me activate the Istanbul card. Besides usual good things like location and cleanliness, there are two that are a really big plus for me.    First are the little decorstional things, that make the place feel like its cared for. Plants, cutlery, little figurines, journals - all these make the place feel warm.   Other thing is the terrace with a pretty view. We had a couple of late dinners there and it was one of the highlights of the trip :) The location is great and the rooms are lovely. I only didn’t know at first if there will be room cleaning service or not, and I expected more friendly people at the reception. Other than that its a good value and we enjoyed our stay Ulaş is the best host, i have ever met on my airbnb experience! He helped us with planning our journey, also with our laggage. Ulaş's house is very clean, cozy and comfortable, here is everything for your comfort! Location is great, 5 minute from beyazit station, near from many sightseeing. this place is also very safe you can walk till midnight. Thank you Ulaş"
