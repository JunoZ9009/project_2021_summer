She has become such a good friend, I cannot even describe how kind and amazing she is. My experiences in Istanbul were beyond my wildest dreams and it is because of Hatice that it all became so special.<br/>The view is far better than even the pictures show. You will make all of your friends and family jealous and in awe at what her apartment offers. Views of so many major landmarks! And at night the Asian side glows like a million little stars along the hilltops. You become hypnotized by all the boats slowly passing by day and night, never stopping. I looked at a lot of Airbnb’s of similar price and location and hers was by far the best value. For hotels with a Bosphorus view in Beyoglu, they start at more than three times what I paid, with 1/4 of the view. For a penthouse suite such as hers, probably about 10-15 times the price, and half or less space.<br/>There are so many great restaurants in the area and Hatice knows some really good ones. To get to ferries and the rail network, a very short walk, faster than a taxi and way more scenic. I found my way around within two days and didn’t really need map apps to get home, even while drinking haha. Easily get to all major sites. Very close to Taksim Square and Istiklal Street. Easy access to get into the place but more secure than anywhere else I’ve been, her front door is almost a bank vault. The streets around the area are so well lit and full of people all hours of the night, you won’t worry about going out at all. But it is so quiet in her top floor, 2 bedroom apartment you would never notice. There’s actually a back balcony she didn’t even mention! I never ran into anyone in the lobby and could come and go as I pleased. In fact, when the city became a bit too overwhelming, you walk in the door and immediately forget once your eyes glimpse the panorama. I considered another Airbnb when I returned for the end of my tour of Turkey. But after meeting Hatice and seeing her place, there was no way anywhere else could be better! Finally, WiFi internet speeds must be mentioned! Faster than anywhere else I’ve been in Turkey. I ended up relying on it a lot! You will not regret it, stay here, make your memories for a lifetime and you’ll cry when you have to check-out, I did! ',\n",

I wanted to cancel but this host cancellation policy didn\\'t include any return and I have paid for a full week. <br/><br/>Pros:<br/>The Host Yakup is a very polite, nice and Communicative. He provided transportation for a fair price. The booking price was great given the size and location of the apartment.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Location:<br/>The location is relatively good. It\\'s 10 minutes away from Taksim, metro and Istiklal st. It\\'s close to many small restaurants and markets.<br/><br/>However, the only way to get to the place is through a very steep road so any old people will find it extremely difficult to walk uphill.

This unit located in the second floor. Recently built. Elevator available but very small (2 people max.) The walls are very thin. we were hearing the boys parties until 3:30 AM.<br/><br/>Living room:<br/>The sofa bed were comfy although dirty. The rug was dirty too and filled with spelling spots. Two big windows with good natural light access.<br/><br/>Bedrooms:<br/>Mattress were good. The sheets, blankets and pillowcases where old and dirty. The queen bed smelled like cigarettes. The other one smelled like mold. Water heater were placed in the bedroom which is loud and make the room hot like hell!<br/><br/>Unavailable Amenities: <br/>No dish washer, No hair dryer, No AC in all bedrooms (very hot during summer), No venting fans in the kitchen or bathroom. Expect the whole place to smell food while cooking. No cleaning equipments. The place became like shit during our stay.

Après plus d’1h de messages à l’hôte en le prévenant de notre avancée et en lui demandant des précisions pour accéder à l’appartement, c’est moyen. De plus, il n’y a pas de parking gratuit comme l’hôte m’avait précisé... mais nous avons finalement payé 50 TL pour 2 jours, donc presque rien. <br/>En bref si vous souhaitez manger dehors, ne pas utiliser le lave linge et visiter Istanbul à pied ce logement est parfait.
